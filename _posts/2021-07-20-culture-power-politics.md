Culture, Power & Politics: WAY OUT CULTURE<br/>
*IRL events*

This Summer join Culture, Power & Politics for a new programme!

What is the connection between culture and power? How do the ideas we have about what is ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ influence our decisions? How did Brexit happen? What is gender? Why do some people think Covid-19 is a hoax? Cultural theory makes use of techniques from philosophy, history, sociology, human geography, anthropology and political and critical theory to examine these and other questions in the context of contemporary popular cultures. 
The course is free because we believe not only that education should be free but that knowledge is a crucial weapon in the war against all forms of inequality. 
If you’ve never been to university, have been but miss the critical debates or are curious about who decides what counts as knowledge in the first place, please join us. 
There is no set reading (although we’ll recommend some if you’re interested) and no essay assignments, exams or deadlines (although we’ll set some if you want to challenge yourself). All the classes are interactive and give you the chance to think about everyday life in the context of the history of ideas. We’ll provide the learning environment. The rest is up to you.
