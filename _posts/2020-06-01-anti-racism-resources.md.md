This year, the festival coincides with a global pandemic and the ongoing wave of state violence, both disproportionately affecting our Black siblings. The Antiuniversity stands in full solidarity with all those taking to the streets and we hope the festival can do its part in creating a space to reflect, share, agitate, educate and organise.

We believe radical self-organised education is important now more than ever. As a collective and over the past five years, we made our anti-racist politics clear. We are aware that this year's fest, organised over the past few months by hundreds of returning and new organisers, has a relatively small number of anti-racist, anti-colonial and anti-state violence events. That's why we are leaving the possibility for organisers wanting to put on relevant content to <a href="https://2020.antiuniversity.org/register" target="_blank">register an event</a> throughout the festival. A few events are already being changed/postponed to a later date in the festival, in view of the weekend's protests, so stay tuned.
