The Antiuniversity and the <a href="https://anarchistbookfair.london/" target="_blank">Anarchist Bookfair in London</a> are joining forces in 2021 to bring together a week-long Antiuniversity Festival from the 4th to the 10th of September and the Anarchist Bookfair on the 11th of September.

To book a stall or a workshop for the Anarchist Bookfair day, please get in touch with the Bookfair Collective early, as spaces might be limited. The physical event has been scaled down in order to be Covid responsible, and we will reassess the ongoing situation.

Antiuniversity events will be programmed in the usual way, directly through the Antiuni website ~2021 edition coming soon~. Submissions will be open from the 3rd to the 24th of July.

The entire festival will take place in-person (when possible) and digitally. ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
