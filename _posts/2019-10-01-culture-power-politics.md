NEW DATES ANNOUNCED!<br/>
**Wednesdays, 16 October - 11 December 2019, 6:30pm**<br/>
Ridley Road Market Bar, 49 Ridley Road, London E8 2NP<br/>

<i>What is the connection between culture and power? How do the ideas we have about what is ‘normal’ or ‘natural’ influence our decisions? How did Brexit happen? What is gender?</i> Cultural theory makes use of techniques from philosophy, history, sociology, human geography, anthropology and political and critical theory to examine these questions in the context of contemporary popular cultures.

There is no set reading (although we’ll recommend some if you’re interested) and no essay assignments, exams or deadlines (although we’ll set some if you want to challenge yourself).
All the classes are interactive and give you the chance to think about everyday life in the context of the history of ideas.
We’ll provide the learning environment. The rest is up to you.

This first part of the course is an introduction to the subject written and delivered by Debra Benita Shaw and Helen Palmer. Part two (dates tba) will be a series of more advanced seminars organised by Jeremy Gilbert with guest speakers. Debra and Jeremy are directors of the Centre for Cultural Studies Research at the University of East London

No need to book, just turn up.
Free to attend, obviously.
