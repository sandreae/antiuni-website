      "description"      : "This Mayday is unlike any previous Maydays. There will be no marches in the streets and no public speeches. Yet, now more than ever, we need to show that we are still here, still angry and still fighting.The Green Anticapitalist Front is calling for an autonomous day of action on the 1st of May. We can’t demonstrate, but that doesn’t mean we can’t revolt. Take action alone or in a small crew. Mutual aid, solidarity, and direct action, all are valid. Keep it serious, keep it quiet. But above all stay safe.Take whatever action you want, online or in your neighbour and at any time throughout the whole day. If you want us to share your action (after the event) on our social media, send us photos and details to greenanticapitalistfront@riseup.net. For downloadable pdf flyers and shareable digital posters in various languages visit our [website event] (https://greenanticapitalist.org/event/mayday-revolt-call-out/)."

      "description"      : "![](http://germinalproductions.com/line.gif)May Day is normally the time we gather in person to make collective demands and celebrate the labour movement. From the fight for the eight-hour day to the movement for international solidarity, May Day has a radical history linking demands and action. This year we cannot physically assemble in the same way as before but we can still take up public space.  We are proposing a **mass banner drop on Friday May 1st between 12pm-6pm**. We would like people to support by hanging a banner out their window, sticking a poster outside their house or even in the park stating their demand for working and living conditions. Please photograph / video your banner drop or message and use the hashtag #maydaydemands when posting on Twitter or Instagram. To keep a record of this action upload your images to [https://maydayrooms.org/maydaydemands](https://maydayrooms.org/maydaydemands)The coronavirus pandemic has only made clearer the inequality so rife in modern Britain and the attack on living and working conditions through austerity, the hostile environment and wage suppression. At this time of crisis we must make clear our demands for the conditions everyone is entitled too. From the utopian to the concrete your demands matter now more than ever. Help make this May Day a memorable fight for a better future.If you need support formulating your demands check out this guide to writing slogans by the Partisan Social Club - [How to write a slogan](https://tinyurl.com/y79jhqc3)If you need help creating your banner Billy Bindley has a step by step guide - [How to make a banner](https://tinyurl.com/yadqdy8p)Or if you&#39;d rather create a poster Protest Press have shared their technique - [How to make a poster](https://tinyurl.com/y8aaw8sx) ![](http://germinalproductions.com/line.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_20.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/line.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_2-1.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_2-2.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_2-3.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_2-4.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_2-5.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/line.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_3-1.gif)![](http://germinalproductions.com/MDM_How-ToGuide_3-2.gif)"

Sean Dockray is an artist and initiator of knowledge-sharing platforms, The Public School and Aaaaarg, both of which use sharing technologies to propose models of learning and accessing information parallel or alternative to institutional education. Brooke Palmieri is a historian, publisher, and rare book antiquarian. In their 2013-2017 PhD, Compelling Reading: The Circulation of Quaker Texts, Palmieri details a relation between Quaker methods of text distribution (crucially tied to the early printing presses) and metaphors of the plague, used to describe a spread of information seen by the Church as uncontrolled, contagious and potentially deadly. At stake in both interviews is the possibility of a (potentially insurgent) public defined by the ways that it transmits texts.**Henry Andersen** *is an artist and organiser living and working in Brussels.

      "description"      : "*the icing room* invites you to join a three-day communal making session that will take place in your own living space. For each afternoon of May Fest our radical intention is simply to *make*. Through this making we propose objects to connect and comfort. The objects we make become symbols of our surroundings, as we rely on the bits and pieces lying around the place, using up old resources, or revisiting things we started and abandoned. Although we are isolated, this communal act creates lines of solidarity that stretch out far beyond ourselves, inviting reflections on labour and production, but also on more personal matters such as attention and togetherness. We are not alone. We will make some playlists to accompany our solitary voyages; these can feed into the process, or not. They will be made available at the start of each making session, which runs from 2pm-4pm. Participants are welcome to join us in all making sessions, or only one, as their mood and materials require."

We will be using [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com) to collect and mix the track. Soundtrap is an online DAW (multitrack recording platform) that lets multiple people record, add effects, edit, remove and change the recording either simultaneously or when they feel like it. To kick things off, I will be hosting a Zoom chat on the 2nd May at 2pm to discuss ideas, explain Soundtrap and work out how best to work. You can register for the Zoom call on the ticket link. I have also set up a Facebook event to share ideas, arrange and organise other meetings and Soundtrap sessions.  I am also keen to hear from people who just want to share an interesting sound clip to add to the collage. Please message me if this is you at roy_smith@hotmail.co.uk  Depending on how those involved feel, we will either create one or a number of tracks that will be sent over to [Strike Radio](http://strikeradio.org/) to add to their 24-hour stream.

Session 1 - Making yarns from strips of fabric, recycled newspapers or plastic bags	Session 2 - Creating holes and slashes	Session 3 - Patching and darning	Session 4 - Recycling old piecesSuitable for all abilities, there will be a series of YouTube videos detailing basic techniques and further ideas, plus an online group forum to post work and discussions.  Working with unconventional, recycled and inexpensive materials, participants will be able to explore and make their own discoveries, while also learning practical skills.  The emphasis is on making experimental samples and artwork, although the techniques can be adapted to repair garments or make functional objects.The workshop aims to rethink the typical women’s craft association of knitting, while exploring both feminist and anti-capitalist ideas.  Holes and worn surfaces symbolise broken systems, while patching and darning can be a both a political statement, or metaphor for mental healing.  Recent research shows that craft activities can improve mental and physical wellbeing, by reducing stress, boosting confidence and enhancing brain productivity.The facebook group will be open across the Antiuniversity Festival (6th-13th June), featuring a daily activity or video, and further posts exploring responsible capitalism and sustainability.Facilitator biography:I initially studied embroidery, before moving through craft and applied arts, and finally achieving a First Class Hons degree in Fine Art.  I have run experimental knitting workshops, at Leyden Gallery (as part of Whitechapel Gallery’s Nocturnal Creatures event), and also at the Supernormal and Greenbelt Festivals.Other projects include, exhibiting at Stuffed (K6 Gallery), The Great Divide (OVADA), Deep Trash Romance (C*ntemporary) and Nasty Woman UK.  I also delivered two conference papers, entitled Slits, Tits and Phallic Knits (Medium Conference, London School of Mosaic), and Freudian Knits and Body Bits (In the Loop at 10, Winchester School of Art)."

Its ideas are based on the groundbreaking book by Belenky et al called &quot;Women’s Ways of Knowing: The Development of Self, Voice, and Mind&quot;. Despite the progress of feminism and social justice, many women still feel silenced in their families, workplaces and in wider society. This book describes the process of cognitive development in women as five perspectives through which women view themselves and their relationship to knowledge. Please read a brief summary (provided on the Eventbrite booking page) of these five perspectives, so that we can make best use of our short time together. Some of the questions we will explore:How is knowledge constructed differently for women? How has this impacted on you?How do Race, Class and Culture further impact on your lived experience?How do we use our insights to live more fully as women?

Instead, we want to meet and have a conversation about what we are doing as artists/activists/humans to resist dominator culture, and what more we need to be doing right now. We are going to assemble at 12h at the main entrance to Lloyd Park, Walthamstow. If you would like to join us for this alternative conversation you are very welcome.

      "description"      : "OPENING MEETING!!!**CORPO.S**A collaboration and series of skill-sharing workshops. CORPO.S (Casually organised reality precarious on screens) is a name we’ve given to a project we’re proposing for antiuniversity festival 2020, which first and foremost is an impetus for a collaboratively produced series of films, made through following a bastardised form of the surrealist parlour game most people know as Exquisite Corpse (also known sometimes as Consequences) The exquisite corpse game in its parlour-based form involves passing a piece of paper from one person to another and drawing a part of a body: participant 1 draws a head; they fold the page back so that only the very base of the neck is visible; they pass the folded page to participant 2; participant 2 draws on, joining to the neck some shoulders, maybe a chest; they fold the page back and pass it on, et cetera. This can last however long and eventually the page is unfolded to reveal a strangely formed body. We’re proposing to borrow the base logic of this parlour-thing and make it into some kind of a public-thing by doing it mostly over zoom and google drives and whatsapp chats in lockdown, given that that’s where, for almost all of us, almost everything beyond us happens. And instead of a drawing, we want to make a film, so that on June 13th, we can screen it in as many places and in as many ways as possible -- projected at night onto a building, hooked up to a billboard, projected out of a bedroom window onto a sheet at the bottom of a residential street (however, whatever people can think of and/or pull off). You don’t need to know anything about making films to be involved!As part of the CORPO.S thing, 3 slots have been booked up during the festival (June 8th, 9th, and 11th) for skill-sharing workshops facilitated by participants in the project. These will include introductory workshops around using open sourced video and audio software, animation, stop-motion, and making DIY camera rigs, among other things (more to come!). These are open to all and notes from them will be uploaded to a public folder for future access. Participants are encouraged to get involved with these workshops and play around with new ways or working and making things, but you are equally welcome to submit a 40 second video from your phone archives of something non-descript -- the only stipulations for submission to the project are as follows:Contributions eventually need to be made into an mp4 file (you can send us a different format but we will have to do some adjusting to make it fit!)Contributions need to be between 30 seconds and 3 minutesEach contribution will be understood as a continuation from the one preceding it (with, however, a pretty broad and expansive understanding of what might be meant by ‘continuation’) Participants are invited to join ongoing group discussions ahead of the festival from May 22nd onwards to propose activities, ideas, and potential collaborations. Follow our instagram page (@exquisitecorpo.s) or like our facebook page **or** email us exquisitecorpos@gmail.com to get involved ahead of June 6th! See the diagram below for a breakdown of the process of getting involved, and for more info and the opportunity to ask questions and raise new ideas, join us for a big zoom to get things rolling and to meet each other(&#39;s faces on screens)at 6pm on June 6th!

Whether Green or Red, Communist or Individualist, Activist or Critical, Anarchists spend as much time defending their own speculative positions on these complicated issues as they do learning what others have to offer — especially other anarchists...**Once upon a time there was an anarchist call for &quot;Anarchism without Adjectives,&quot; referring to a doctrine that tolerated the co-existence of different schools of anarchist thought. Instead of qualifying Anarchism as collectivist, communist, or individualist, Anarchism without Adjectives refused to preconceive economic solutions to a post-revolutionary time. Instead, Anarchism without Adjectives argued that the abolition of authority, not squabbling over the future, is of primary importance.*An online discussion about Aragorn!’s essay Anarchy Without Road Maps or Adjectives, hosted by FORGED BOOKS, Manchester’s anarchist reading group.Conversation will take place on the jitsi platform here: **https://8X8.vc/forged/books**We recommend the Chromium browser on desktop: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/Chrome should also work.

Through the Deep Listening® practice, as developed by the late composer/activist/artist Pauline Oliveros, we will focus on listening and sound making as a way in to a greater awareness of our acoustic ecologies, inside and out, by opening our ears to our surroundings and the sonic tapestries of our individual environments, and bringing into focus our listening as a kind of activism, a process of self-discovery and sonic self-care. Through Deep Listening® exercises, bodywork, and ’Sonic Meditations’ - text scores written by Oliveros in 1971 - we will connect, move and sound with our surroundings, expanding our awareness of the sonic environment, externally and internally, in a collaborative, experimental and playful way, for personal and community growth. This workshop is open to all with no previous experience needed, just a willingness to participate!The workshop is facilitated by Banc Sceol - artists and certified Deep Listening® practitioners Stephen Shiell &amp; Hannah White."

      "description"      : "About usRe(s)public collective is an interdisciplinary research collective. We rethink the narratives of space and its related disciplines through critical design, fine arts and architecture. We believe in conversation, learning through making, and in the future, offering space for reflection on art and creative practice through research.Sophie Mak-Schram is an art historian, educator, (creative) writer and occasional performer, whose past projects include Overheard Map and Tail Bend Travel. She is interested in how we know and what forms that knowledge can take. She likes to make playful, intentionally uncertain work in collaboration with others.Brief description Smell is a sense that contains a rich amount of knowledge, culture, and history. What might we learn or tell through smell, that we cannot learn or tell through other means? As our lifestyles (privileged as they are) tend towards the visual and the verbal - think of the many Zoom calls, emails, and texts we exchange daily - this workshop invites you to think about smell as a means of knowing. Smell is a sense that is intimately interwoven into memory-making, and yet one we often do not discuss informal, academic, or institutional contexts.During this workshop, participants will compose a scent that explains (an aspect of) their creative or activist practice, and reflect on the role smell does and can play in new forms of knowledge. This workshop also aims to offer/build new forms of communication and experience between participants, creating connections of new sensorial practice."

If we once used words like &quot;alienation&quot; or &quot;isolation&quot; as figures of speech to describe our mental condition, we now find they are material states of being. Could this be our &quot;new normal&quot;?~~Together, we will consider how we *inhabit the everyday* and look at examples of *artistic processes* that transform, distort, deny or pursue it. We will talk about things like: What is a politics of the ordinary, the non-exceptional, the bog-standard? What is the &quot;everyday&quot; and how are we shaped by it? How can we use common languages and materials to (re)create worlds? How do we (re)invent the outside from the inside? The convenors will throw in a mixed bag of art and ideas for discussion: the Readymade, dérive, architectonics, atmospheric attunements, autofiction, micro-actions, the infrathin. As co-producers of knowledge, the group is invited to use the session as an open forum, to share their thoughts and experiences on art, mind and the social. Attendees will receive the session material and an audio-guide in a follow-up e-mail.

We are a national campaign made up of an international collective of British, EU and non-EU migrant students, lecturers, university workers and migrant activists opposed to the hostile environment policy and border controls inside UK higher education. Our hashtag, #BordersKillKnowledge we Illustrate the egregious moments in the UK where the recent intensification of the hostile environment has denied scholars (and thus all of us) the benefits that would have come from thinking together. Not coincidentally, this kind of denial seems to happen most frequently to scholars of African, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Latin American origin.In our resistant workshop, we explore how non-EU and EU migrants have been exploited by both the Home Office and UK higher education institutions through the use of intensive attendance monitoring. This exploitation has created visible and invisible barriers. These barriers leave migrant students, lecturers, and university workers vulnerable to institutional racism and xenophobia, housing discrimination, health discrimination, surveillance, and poverty.We will draw on examples of casework that we&#39;ve done in addition to our recent study of how the hostile environment policy functions inside UK higher education. We will also discuss our new study on understanding how universities are incorporating further use of a variety of  online technologies as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, and what this means in relation to the hostile environment policy. We encourage all students, lecturers, university workers &amp; anti-racist activists to organise with us and fight against the incursion of more pernicious surveillance methods within your respective institutions that seek to criminalise and further oppress migrants, particularly those who are Black, Muslim, and PoC.

These two events and your ideas will help to actively guide the direction we as a group decide to take in the future.We will initially be working towards creating shared resources called ‘The imaginary Seed Bank’. This will begin as a series of google docs which will be created that people from ‘The Ecological Intervention Research Group’ can have access and add ideas too and will also act to allow for conversations from meet-ups to continue. Creativity, resourcefulness, the sharing of knowledge, education and hope will be key functions of this group.For the first meeting please think about a 10 min introduction to your work/ideas/hopes for the future, and ideas of what you’d be interested in the group to explore.

Over the two hour session you will be gently guided to improvise with strangers using the *‘Play Act Cards’* we developed working with a group of acting enthusiasts last summer in Beeston, South Leeds. The cards give you prompts for your character, the place you find yourself, the atmosphere and an opening line for your scene. Whatever follows next follows, no pressure. However you respond is up to you and where your group takes it!This process is designed for anyone to play, no performance or acting experience needed - just a willingness to give it a go. Over zoom we will break into smaller groups and see where the cards take us. Wana pretend you&#39;re having your hair cut? Wana imagine what playgrounds will be like after lockdown? Wana develop your character into a member of a feminist militia? Imagine yourself as a benevolent developer? Throw back to the feudal system? Fast forward to luxury communism? You can! In the comfortable space of our collective imaginations and on the other side of a laptop screen.The aim of the game is to step outside of yourself and into another person&#39;s shoes, to empathise with who that other person might be, share the view from where they are and begin to imagine how they might respond to the other people, places and things around them. Use costumes, props from your kitchen, or just method-act your way through. It’s up to you. It’s different every time we play but it’s always a laugh. You will have the option to record your ‘act’ and to share with the group.*Private zoom link will be sent out ahead of the event with password.*--Sophie Chapman + Kerri Jefferis make artworks with others in radically non-hierarchical ways. Our work explores the strangeness of imagining other worlds and ways of being together. Recognising lived experience, we set out to capture social time and reveal the macro politics in micro acts, and find our audience in the moment of making itself. Over the past five years we have produced film, furniture, scores, situations, performances and publications.

      "description"      : "The Århus Feminist Reading Group is a collaborative project that investigates feminisms through group reading and conversation. We have been meeting in the Danish city of Aarhus since May 2017 to discuss novels, short stories, poems and articles, and we also put on talks, workshops and screenings under our umbrella organisation, Århus Feminist Collective. As a result of the pandemic we have moved our programme online.To mark our third year of reading group activity, we are looking back to some of the first writers we discussed in the early weeks and months of the group. For our event with Antiuniversity, we will consider an essay by Rebecca Solnit, as well as a critique of Solnit’s approach to feminist politics by Viviane Fairbank.The themes of the discussion will include silence, voice, and sexual violence, as well as what role hope should play in feminist theorising and organising. Is hope what we need to imagine other worlds and recognise the changes that are happening, or is too much optimism simply a distraction from the work still left to be done? To register for the event please email aarhusfeministcollective@gmail.com and we will send you the reading and a link for the video call. We will either use zoom or google hangout depending on how many people register. The preparatory reading will be around 40 (short) pages and an online article. Whilst we really encourage participants to read beforehand, you are of course welcome to join in with your thoughts and ideas even if you weren&#39;t able to. We can also revisit specific parts of the texts during the meeting and read sections aloud. The event time in the listing is UK time! Please adjust according to your location. "

Describe people of African heritage as African or as of African heritage (not origin), instead of black.2. The opportunity for study of African history or Africana to be made more accessible, and either descriptor be used, instead of black history or black studies. 3. When itemising racial discriminations, then use Afriphobia (note the spelling with an &quot;i&quot;), which refers to the prejudice or discrimination against; fear, hatred, or bigotry towards people of African heritage and things African, instead or anti-black racism or lumping it under racism.4. Use AAME (African, Asian, Minority Ethnic) terminology, instead of BAME (Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic), which excludes the African identity. 5. Make time to observe August 31 as African History Reflection Day.6. A final decision to be made on whether to use the 4 or 5 band Global African quad flag, which combines the colours of the two pan-African colours, as the visual identifier of African-centred matters.The African Coalition event is led by BTWSC/African Histories Revisited, TAOBQ (The African Or Black Question) and supporters including Bro Glenroy Watson, Bro Minkah"

      "description"      : "In April- May 1983 Dario Fo and Franca Rame visited London and delivered 4 workshops at Riverside Studios. [**Red Notes**](http://rednotes.net/about/) published later a pamphlet with notes from the workshops, an interview with the two militant theatre makers and four plays (three of them previously untranslated).For this session we chose to collectively read Franca Rame’s monologue **&quot;La Madre&quot;** (The Mother) and Fo’s **&quot;Waking Up&quot;**, performed by Rame. Both plays are elaborating the notion of motherhood, the sacrifices, the loss of one’s self, the guilt, the love. We will read them together online – something like a collective participatory radio play, in which anyone can join, and give our collective voices to a monologue that belongs to all of us.With this Antiuniversity session [**MayDay Rooms**](https://maydayrooms.org) is celebrating the collection **Ed Emery** deposited with us last year with his translations of dramas by Dario Fo. Ed began his collaborations with Fo in the early 1980s, and has produced a large number of translations of plays.**The reading will be followed by a short discussion.**This session will take place alongside our [screening](https://2020.antiuniversity.org/events/screening-the-accidental-death-of-an-anarchist-1984-discussion) of the Channel 4’s legendary production of Fo’s **‘The Accidental Death of an Anarchist’** on **Friday 12th June, 8pm @ Antiuniversity.****To get the texts and zoom link use the Eventbrite link below.**"

      "description"      : "Free education was a demand outlined in response to the introduction of tuition fees across the higher education sector over the past twenty years. Students and workers have fought against the marketisation of the education and in the process formulated an alternative vision that goes far beyond this original demand. In this workshop, we&#39;ll explore what free education means, the ways we can fight for it, and how Solidarity College relates to all this. Raewyn Connell is Professor Emerita at the University of Sydney. Connell is known for introducing the concept of hegemonic masculinity and work on class, education, gender, and southern knowledge. In 2019, Connell published the Good University which explores the fundamentals of the higher education and offers a practical vision for a different kind of University. The book came out of Connell&#39;s experiences in strike action at the University of Sydney in 2013.We&#39;ll discuss Chapter Seven of the Good University which explores &#39;Universities of hope&#39;.

CORPO.S (Casually organised reality precarious on screens) is a name we’ve given to a project we’re proposing for antiuniversity festival 2020, which first and foremost is an impetus for a collaboratively produced series of films, made through following a bastardised form of the surrealist parlour game most people know as Exquisite Corpse (also known sometimes as Consequences) The exquisite corpse game in its parlour-based form involves passing a piece of paper from one person to another and drawing a part of a body: participant 1 draws a head; they fold the page back so that only the very base of the neck is visible; they pass the folded page to participant 2; participant 2 draws on, joining to the neck some shoulders, maybe a chest; they fold the page back and pass it on, et cetera. This can last however long and eventually the page is unfolded to reveal a strangely formed body. We’re proposing to borrow the base logic of this parlour-thing and make it into some kind of a public-thing by doing it mostly over zoom and google drives and whatsapp chats in lockdown, given that that’s where, for almost all of us, almost everything beyond us happens. And instead of a drawing, we want to make a film, so that on June 13th, we can screen it in as many places and in as many ways as possible -- projected at night onto a building, hooked up to a billboard, projected out of a bedroom window onto a sheet at the bottom of a residential street (however, whatever people can think of and/or pull off). You don’t need to know anything about making films to be involved!As part of the CORPO.S thing, 3 slots have been booked up during the festival (June 8th, 9th, and 11th) for skill-sharing workshops facilitated by participants in the project. These will include introductory workshops around using open sourced video and audio software, animation, stop-motion, and making DIY camera rigs, among other things (more to come!). These are open to all and notes from them will be uploaded to a public folder for future access. Participants are encouraged to get involved with these workshops and play around with new ways or working and making things, but you are equally welcome to submit a 40 second video from your phone archives of something non-descript -- the only stipulations for submission to the project are as follows:Contributions eventually need to be made into an mp4 file (you can send us a different format but we will have to do some adjusting to make it fit!)Contributions need to be between 30 seconds and 3 minutesEach contribution will be understood as a continuation from the one preceding it (with, however, a pretty broad and expansive understanding of what might be meant by ‘continuation’) Participants are invited to join ongoing group discussions ahead of the festival from May 22nd onwards to propose activities, ideas, and potential collaborations. Follow our instagram page (@exquisitecorpo.s) or like our facebook page **or** email us exquisitecorpos@gmail.com to get involved ahead of June 6th! See the diagram below for a breakdown of the process of getting involved, and for more info and the opportunity to ask questions and raise new ideas, join us for a big zoom to get things rolling and to meet each other(&#39;s faces on screens)at 6pm on June 6th!

Beyond the art school where does study happen, and what deems intellectuality? There will be a series of 20-minute, study conversations interspersed with 10-minute moments of care and everyday activity that will allow us to focus on the relationship between our bodies and our knowledge.The focus of the event unpicks domestic and social experiences as moments of making and learning, through the text we will read together, making possible moments of collective making and study. The text will be a jumping off point to make short collective happenings/ works via zoom and offline in our homes.Beginning by introducing and reading together, we will then write together, listen together, and collectively prepare a meal in our own homes before communally dining together at the end of the event.If you sign up to the event please pass on your postal address and we will send you a small care package of:A notebook (or paper) / Pencil / Ingredients to prepare a meal&quot;When I think about the way we use the term ‘study,’ I think we are committed to the idea that study is what you do with other people. It’s talking and walking around with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice. The notion of a rehearsal – being in a kind of workshop, playing in a band, in a jam session, or old men sitting on a porch, or people working together in a factory – there are these various modes of activity. The point of calling it ‘study’ is to mark that the incessant and irreversible intellectuality of these activities is already present.&quot;We are happy to talk to anyone who wants to talk to us.Event Date: 11th June 2020 (3-6pm) Please arrive to zoom 10 mins before the start, please let us know of any dietary requirements, audio or visual requirements or specific access needs.The event will be hosted over zoom and a link will be sent to registered participants prior to the event.Here is the PDF of the book: https://monoskop.org/images/9/95/Harney_Stefano_Moten_Fred_The_Undercommons_Fugitive_Planning_and_Black_Study_2013.pdfDownload is free from publisher and they recommend purchasing if you love it as much as us!"

Imagine an orchestra if you will, all working together in unison around a fixed scale to create a harmonious sound. In this respect, Yap’s work is all about showing you how your mind can be recalibrated to work around the correct scale of reality.

You can add (but are not limited too): life hacks and how-to’s, links to opportunities, budgeting advice, tax-tips, your personal info, artists’ rights, good art shops or meet-up spaces in your city, van hire contacts and so on! This will also be a good opportunity to link up, critique, examine or feedback on Mesh as it works today.  "

This session is an introduction for people who are new to image editing tools, or who want to go from commercial programs to free and open source graphic programs (known as ‘Libre Graphics’).There are a range of Libre Graphics programs available. We’ll be focussing on two popular tools for this session: Inkscape and GIMP (Gnu Image Manipulation Program). They are a great pairing for making flyers, posters and web graphics. We’ll explain the differences between them, and show you how to get the most out of using them together.Inkscape and GIMP are both available for Windows, Mac and Linux. To get the most out of the session, please take a moment to download and install them in advance:[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org){Image is a remix by ch of Libre Graphics Mag Cover vol 1.2 by Manufactura Independente based on images by Flickr user fdctsevilla.

This has been theorized in a thousand ways, described in environmental, social, and political terms, it has been prophesied, abstracted, and narrated in real time, and still we are unsure of what to do with it. The underlying point is that the progress of society has nothing to offer us and everything to take away. Often it feels like we are giving it away without a fight: when we sell our time for money, allow our passions to be commodified, invest ourselves in the betterment of society, or sustain ourselves on the spoils of ecological destruction, we openly (though not consensually) participate in our own destruction.**The question hangs in an ethereal and ghastly voice*: Why do you let yourselves be led to the slaughter like sheep? *As Hermann Langbein addresses in* Against All Hope: Resistance in the Nazi Concentration Camps, *the survivors of those most explicit of human slaughter houses have been plagued by that question for decades, to which some have simply replied*: we didn’t.An online discussion about Serafinski&#39;s introduction to &#39;Blessed is the Flame&#39; (**p.1-18**, inc. &#39;Anarcho-nihilism&#39;, &#39;Collision&#39; &amp; &#39;The Ceaseless Lager&#39;) hosted by FORGED BOOKS, Manchester’s anarchist reading group.Online conversations take place on the Jitsi platform here: **https://8X8.vc/forged/books**We recommend the Chromium browser on desktop: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/Chrome should also work.

How would a co-operative art school work? What would the membership responsibilities be?  How would we organise ourselves in a non-hierarchical way to address inequalities and include everyone in decision-making?Alternative models of art education abound, but as Richard Sennet argues in *Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Cooperation* (2012), we don’t have opportunities to practice the necessary skills in self-organisation and cooperation that are required to create and maintain commons-based economies. Alienation and exploitation can only be countered by social, collective and co-operative practices that foster community, equality, inclusivity and mutual aid.The workshop will begin with a reading seminar on self-organisation and conclude with a workshop on leadership roles for leaderless groups, based on *The Empowerment Manual: A guide for collaborative groups* (2011), by the writer, teacher and activist Starhawk.Please book your place. For more information and to download the texts please visit https://videomole.tv/antiuni2020. The texts highlight aspects of group dynamics in collectives and groups, providing starting points for the discussion. We will unpack the concept of self-organisation and address a series of questions in the seminar. Please read the texts in advance of the workshop and bring your own questions along.This workshop is part of **A co-operative art school?** a research project that explores potential models for a co-operative form of art education. It is an extended call for collaborators who want to address the problems of art education and work together to establish an alternative model to the corporatised, marketised and financialised capitalist university.

      "description"      : "A virtual guided tour of the Tate Modern celebrating women artists, examining the relationship between the Women&#39;s Movement and the History of Art.As part of the Antiuniversity Festival 2020, Other Visions is putting on a unique virtual guided tour through the Tate Modern exploring the lives of women artists. We will examine what it means to be a ‘woman artist’ in a man’s world and investigate the ways women have used visual representation to disrupt dominant ideology.Women artists have historically been excluded from the cultural institution that is the art world: the reviews, the exhibitions, the art history books, the museums. This tour will uncover the hidden histories of women artists, and look at the ways their relationship to this historic exclusion has informed their work. Now, as the tide slowly begins to turn, we will examine how the current curation of the Tate Modern has reflected that history.Drawing from a range of different cultural, historical, and mythological sources that women have used as tools to liberation, Volatile Women will investigate how feminism has been used to reinterpret and resituate women’s narratives.Hatty Bush created Other Visions Art Tours as part of the Antiuniversity 2019 Summer Festival. She has a BA in Art History and English Literature, and an MA in Gender, Society and Representation from University College London, where she specialised in the representation of feminism within art institutions. She lectures and hosts workshops on social politics and art history at a range of feminist collective events.Other Visions Art Tours seeks to resituate the histories of art to include a range of different perspectives still all too often overlooked in traditional analysis. By destabilising conventional historiographies, Other Visions critically examines visual culture, with specialised focus on subjectivity, gender and sexuality."

For this session in the Antiuniversity we want to screen Channel 4’s legendary production of Fo&#39;s ‘The Accidental Death of an Anarchist’. A 1984 film adaptation of Dario Fo’s uncompromising militant left-wing dramatization of the suspicious circumstances of the death of an anarchist railway worker. Based around the 1969 bombing of Piazza Fontana and the death of Giuseppe Pinelli.**Dario Fo** was Italy’s most important post-war playwright, famous for his irreverent and outrageous political theatre. His work often delivers direct commentary on the radical politics of his time, while reviving historical forms of comedy, farce, and minstrelsy as a theatre from below. Ed began his collaborations with Fo in the early 1980s, and has produced a large number of translations of plays. This session will take place alongside our collective online read-through of some of this work on Wednesday 10th June, 8pm @ Antiuniversity. "

We want to build an open-source platform that will:- Bolster mood, provide an optimistic, thought-provoking and practical programme for arts graduates during the inevitable anticlimax of online degree shows.- Create a forum of opportunity, a place to gather and a movement to rally around at the point where usually everyone disperses.- Provide a springboard to counter the feeling of standing at a precipice.We invite every art and design school to help develop the anti degree show. We are in the early stages of the planning process and need all your input! We need artists, coders, designers, philosophers and a diverse range of students to make this platform a success. So come along to the open meeting!"

Part performance, part conversation, part powerpoint, part game, part provocation; the new games movement is an experiment into how we can share ideas, amplify quieter voices, invite collective movement and action in uncertain times.This event will share some initial experiments into the new games movement created this year by children and young people at Rumpus Room and ask questions about what  the new games movement could be. All welcome to join the event in whatever way they feel - to listen, watch or contribute. Rumpus Room is an artist-led organisation dedicated to collaborative practice with children, young people and families in order to challenge how we learn, play and make art. Rumpus Room proposes to investigate and open up new modes of collaborative working that are inclusive and accessible, and encourage risk and experimentation, placing children, young people and families at the centre of collaboration with artists whilst supporting a mutual exchange of experiences working across practices. Rumpus Room Studio HQ is in Govanhill in Glasgow, Scotland. The new games movement is led by artist Jamie Bolland. Jamie is a teacher, artist and skateboarder living and working in Glasgow. The new games movement has been shaped by open performance and game playing sessions with a group of children and young people at Rumpus Room Studio in early 2020. "

She was the first woman—and only woman of colour—elected as President of Leicester University Students Union.About the BookIlluminating her inner journey growing up mixed-race in Britain, Esua Jane Goldsmith&#39;s unique memoir exposes the isolation and ambiguities that often come with being ‘an only’.Raised in 1950s South London and Norfolk with a white, working-class family, Esua’s education in racial politics was immediate and personal. From Britain and Scandinavia to Italy and Tanzania, she tackled inequality wherever she saw it, establishing an inspiring legacy in the Women’s lib and Black Power movements.Plagued by questions of her heritage and the inability to locate all pieces of herself, she embarks on a journey to Ghana to find the father who may have the answers.A tale of love, comradeship, and identity crises, Esua’s rise to the first Black woman president of Leicester University Students’ Union and Queen Mother of her village, is inspiring, honest, and full of heart."

      "description"      : "MASS SCREENING OF A COLLABORATIVELY MADE FILMon sunday the 13th of june we are proposing for as many people as possible to set up guerilla screens in public spaces (sheets, projectors, hacked billboards!) to screen the films made by the CORPO.S exquisite corpse film project throughout AntiUniversity Festival 2020 (see below for details). Tune in via zoom if not in the streets  **CORPO.S**A collaboration and series of skill-sharing workshops. CORPO.S (Casually organised reality precarious on screens) is a name we’ve given to a project we’re proposing for antiuniversity festival 2020, which first and foremost is an impetus for a collaboratively produced series of films, made through following a bastardised form of the surrealist parlour game most people know as Exquisite Corpse (also known sometimes as Consequences) The exquisite corpse game in its parlour-based form involves passing a piece of paper from one person to another and drawing a part of a body: participant 1 draws a head; they fold the page back so that only the very base of the neck is visible; they pass the folded page to participant 2; participant 2 draws on, joining to the neck some shoulders, maybe a chest; they fold the page back and pass it on, et cetera. This can last however long and eventually the page is unfolded to reveal a strangely formed body. We’re proposing to borrow the base logic of this parlour-thing and make it into some kind of a public-thing by doing it mostly over zoom and google drives and whatsapp chats in lockdown, given that that’s where, for almost all of us, almost everything beyond us happens. And instead of a drawing, we want to make a film, so that on June 13th, we can screen it in as many places and in as many ways as possible -- projected at night onto a building, hooked up to a billboard, projected out of a bedroom window onto a sheet at the bottom of a residential street (however, whatever people can think of and/or pull off). You don’t need to know anything about making films to be involved!As part of the CORPO.S thing, 3 slots have been booked up during the festival (June 8th, 9th, and 11th) for skill-sharing workshops facilitated by participants in the project. These will include introductory workshops around using open sourced video and audio software, animation, stop-motion, and making DIY camera rigs, among other things (more to come!). These are open to all and notes from them will be uploaded to a public folder for future access. Participants are encouraged to get involved with these workshops and play around with new ways or working and making things, but you are equally welcome to submit a 40 second video from your phone archives of something non-descript -- the only stipulations for submission to the project are as follows:Contributions eventually need to be made into an mp4 file (you can send us a different format but we will have to do some adjusting to make it fit!)Contributions need to be between 30 seconds and 3 minutesEach contribution will be understood as a continuation from the one preceding it (with, however, a pretty broad and expansive understanding of what might be meant by ‘continuation’) Participants are invited to join ongoing group discussions ahead of the festival from May 22nd onwards to propose activities, ideas, and potential collaborations. Follow our instagram page (@exquisitecorpo.s) or like our facebook page **or** email us exquisitecorpos@gmail.com to get involved ahead of June 6th! See the diagram below for a breakdown of the process of getting involved, and for more info and the opportunity to ask questions and raise new ideas, join us for a big zoom to get things rolling and to meet each other(&#39;s faces on screens)at 6pm on June 6th!

      "description"      : "Come to celebrate the publication of a book documenting the life of the first three years of The Field. For the first time we’ll bring north of the river some of spirit(s) that animated this attempt at doing things differently, dis-organising against the grain of hierarchical structures, neoliberal competition and the slavery of work. With this event we intend to bring the awkwardness that characterised some of The Field’s experiments back to life by engaging in activities like reading aloud, talking, moving, drawing, shifting energies, to get a sense that another brave world in commons and care is possible.From when The Field began until just around the time we began working on this book in June 2016, The Field was purposefully researching ways to utilise critical theory and creative work for political ends. That is, the field wanted nothing to do with the speculative cultural economy and the art world. Rather, as this book documents with its charts, graphs, founding documents and email exchanges, it utilized critical theory for intensely retrospective and externally creative purposes in effort to found an meaningful neighborhood-based activist space.  This book documents that. The book is published by Parakeet Press, a new collaborative imprint of the Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Protest and Beyond Repair. "

How can we exceed the limitations of individual movement?As a group, we will walk from point A to point B. The action of walking will function as a constant motion from which all subsequent actions will follow. We will provide a structure in which every participant is welcome to introduce a prompt, providing equal opportunity to direct the collective movement. Through the series of these instruction-led changes we aim to move as one body.Inspired by Theatre of the Oppressed, instruction-led choreography, contact improvisation, and in the spirit of anti-university, we aim to bring to the fore bodily methods of collectivity as a starting point for contemporary self organisation.The  workshop will last approximately one hour thirty minutes, including a short introduction, and reflection. Please wear comfortable clothing. We welcome participants of all capabilities, ages and backgrounds. For those interested, we would love you to join us for a drink after (pub TBC)."

Is the internet a powerful new tool of democratic engagement, or is it just driving everyone crazy, spreading fake news and stoking paranoia? Have postmodern societies become completely ungovernable? And if they have, should we care? Is liberal democracy finished, and if not, is it worth trying to save? Is neoliberalism in a terminal phase, or is it more powerful than ever? Could we end up with our own version of Trump in power? Would it make things any worse if we did?

Given the lack of representation within universities, students of colour are forced to centre their learning on the critical thinking of white academics whilst navigating a space that still denies academics of colour and those from the global south, the representation and voices that they deserve.This talk will consider ways and means in which the student experience can be deinstitutionalised, from safe study spaces to interdisciplinary peer networks."

But what if we invert the formula?What are the symbols that structure our cosmos and how can we re-imagine them to collectively transform ourselves and our actions in the world? In other words, rather than simply interpreting symbols, how can we change them?Situated between a social experiment and a performance without an audience,the session will allow us to come together to design a new speculative tarot deck and do a group reading from it.The session will include:- An introduction to the elemental structure of the tarot- Symbol generation exercises- Creating a deck of cards collaboratively- Doing a reading from the deck we produce"

Fundamentally we are all human beings and have accumulated vast experience in life that are our great joy to ourselves and society to share and celebrate!The activity will start with a brief introduction to the meaning and practice of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo for 15-20 minutes; then open group discussion and any questions people may have followed by a picnic for those wanting to stay."

There are a plethora of devices meant to help people understand and interpret biofeedback, ranging from fitness trackers (like Garmin and Fitbit) to emotion and stress trackers (like Spire and Pip). However, the way these systems are interpreting biosignal data is not transparent to us as users and may even conflict with how we interpret our own data. By assuming our devices cannot accurately interpret our biosignals, we will be able to produce new ways of visualizing our data and reclaim agency over our biofeedback.This event explores low cost ways to collect biosignals without expensive devices as well as new ways to explore and interpret our own data, disrupting preconceived notions of what our bio signals represent. Participants will be asked questions to explore this topic: How do biosensing trackers fail to understand our data? And in what ways does biosensing create a point of conflict between how the hardware sees us and how we see our ourselves? What ways can we visualize our biosignals to more accurately reflect these personal interpretations?"

This shift, from a criminal justice approach to health-based policy making, is essential if we want to take drug policy into the 21st century. It is time for the UK to catch up, and develop and promote appropriate, evidence-based, and sustainable alternatives both in the UK and globally.But while calls for decriminalization and legal regulation of the drugs trade are a step in the right direction, we need to ensure that legalization does not become a vehicle for corporate to take over the drugs trade. We need legal regulation that serves social justice not capital.In this panel discussion, we bring together speakers from trade unions, racial justice campaigners, farmers working in the drugs trade to discuss what legal regulation could look like.

It is the opium of the people.” Turning towards our existence in a suffering planet, we inhale the steam of our raging hearts, dance to the sounds of our shouts into the void of a muted existence and lose ourselves in the ecstasies of our love to the universe. The earth is our lover, mother and goddess, and, re-connecting with traditions originating in Alchemy, Analytical Psychology and Witchcraft, we engage in self-created rituals to celebrate our desire for all that is excluded from the matrix of human supremacy. In the same way in which the Alchemists aimed at a total sympoietic tangling facilitated by the materiality of their earthly existence, this experimental workshop invites its participants to take part at an revelry of with-making, myth-making, worlding and un-worlding. Through these practices, we will endeavour to wake up or brighten the fundamentally spiritual love for the Earth that is already natural to us. Loving  is something fundamental to being. These practices do not only aim to bring us closer to the Earth but to ourselves. We will create a space where environmental activism and spirituality engender practical tools for radical social transformation."

      "description"      : "This ninety-minute introductory workshop, based on the facilitator&#39;s ongoing training with NYC vocal teacher Robert Sussuma (vocallearningsystems.com), will explore vocal learning from the 21st century perspective of sensory awareness. There will be NO lip trills and NO rag dolls warm-ups. The workshop is an attempt to introduce you to experiential, somatics - and Feldenkrais-based, vocal education.  It aims to provide lifelong tools for self-learning (applicable to any artistic practice) through the concepts of variations and &#39;unexpected learning&#39;. We all use our voices. Most of us don&#39;t really understand or even ever think about what&#39;s going on &#39;down there&#39; or the actual interactions between all the related parts of our sound-producing &#39;system&#39;, from toes to top of the spine. This free workshop is therefore open to all, from complete novices to voice professionals alike. No special equipment or clothing required.The self-awareness workshop begins with you setting a reference for yourself (by singing or speaking a short phrase of your own choosing, as privately as the space will allow—this is not a performance nor a talent show). We will then proceed to gather sensory information about your own vocal apparatus, allowing us to look at how we tend to think (and imagine) the different parts of our own voice (you&#39;ll be surprised by the exploration). Through Feldenkrais-styled experiential learning (consisting of small, barely perceptible and sometimes purely imagined movements), with playfulness essential (as per neurological science) to the process, we will explore the art of self-sensing. The workshop ends with a return to the initial reference &#39;phrase&#39;, at which point participants can sense for themselves (again, this is not a performance to be assessed by either teacher or other participants) what may have, often in very unexpected ways, shifted. This deeply personal, subjective and sensory exploration of our own selves brings a new—and lasting—ease and joy in our own voice. With surprising and more exciting options available to us as singers, actors, and speakers, we gain a more stable and lasting self-confidence in our own, unique and deeply personal artistic choices.For further information, please look for introductory videos and a complete series of online workshops, as well as one-on-one training, from Robert Sussuma&#39;s Vocal Learning Systems. He&#39;s the real deal. https://vocallearningsystems.com/.   Looping the Loop is a festival of live arts in the three towns of Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs in Thanet on the East Kent coast.  Theatre Network Thanet is a monthly meet up for locally-based actors, artists, directors, writers, producers and theatre-makers.  FLEX is run by Looping the Loop and is a free weekly skills- and resources-sharing opportunity for practitioners of all creative fields to come and explore and learn from each other, test out ideas, keeping our creativity sparked and honing your skills. Professional and aspiring performance practitioners, artists interested in performance and any/all theatre types are invited to join.  OSE Open School East  is a space for artistic learning and production that is experimental, versatile and highly collaborative. We run two mutually reinforcing strands: - A free study programme for emerging artists; - A multifaceted programme of events, activities and training open to all. Central to Open School East’s approach is a commitment to foster cultural, intellectual and social exchanges between artists and the broader public. We do this by opening our study programme outwards, responding to our locality and providing an informal environment for the sharing of knowledge and skills across various communities – artistic, local and otherwise. Open School East was originally founded in 2013 in East London, in response to spiralling tuition fees and student debt, and the decrease in both studio provision and civic spaces in the capital. From 2013 to 2016, Open School East operated from the Rose Lipman Building, a former library and community centre in De Beauvoir Town, East London. In 2017, we relocated to the coastal town of Margate in Kent, where we will contribute to the town’s cultural vitality and open up creative opportunities for people of all ages and backgrounds. We are located on the ground floor of the Pettman building, below Resort Studios, in Cliftonville. http://www.openschooleast.org"

      "description"      : "A decade after the international financial crash, crisis has become a pervading condition across the world and thus the new “global reality”. Dispossession, exclusion, suppression, loss and/or precariousness are today established normalities for the majority of the world population. Seeing our contemporary context from the lens of social reproduction enables a holistic understanding of this worldwide critical situation, for the multiple crises we face constitute different manifestations of a socioeconomic system that finds it increasingly difficult to sustain itself simply because it is doing away with the ways of sustaining life on our planet. Today, the crisis of social reproduction has acquired a global scale expanding across all capitalist societies and enhancing those forms of organising our material and social sustenance that are grounded in long-established social inequalities. However, the current multi-faceted crisis has become also a “truth regime” through which the dominant powers have installed a perennial state of exception. The regime of chronic-crisis is sustained on “TINA discourses”, which are deployed to make us believe that “there-is-no-alternative” so they can continue governing us according to their extractivist interests.We propose to fight this regime of chronic-crisis by feeding an emancipatory social imagination of care that allows us to collectively envision alternative forms of organising the sustenance of our own selves, our societies and our planet. In other words, to imagine new ways of how care and reproductive needs can be provided, by whom, in which conditions and in which spaces. We invite contributors to create “Frontida: Towards a radical imagination of care”, a manifesto in the form of a (trans)urban utopia. In this one-day workshop we will discuss, imagine and produce the first draft of “Frontida”, which will later be translated into a self-publication that will be sent to each creator and distributed to the general public.  Three working groups will be responsible for the outline of the main ideas in each corresponding area, namely organisational units, spaces and networks. An additional group will devise how to get to Frontida. At the end of the day, those will be presented and discussed in a plenary session in which a common draft will be jointly agreed."

The practice involves embodying a character in an immersive fictional setting and co-creating play with others. Everyone is welcome and no prior experience is necessary, the pre-larp workshop will cover all techniques needed in the larp.It involves long periods of walking around outside (around 2 hours) with short breaks along the way. Please wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for the weather.

      "description"      : "The Demystification Committee investigates self-organising nonhuman beings in their debut short film INTERFACE CHAOS, accompanied by an original soundtrack by SKY H1.Two palm trees endemic to a single island in the archipelago of the Seychelles search for a home and a means to live and love, interfacing with the chaos of nature. This land is shared with Money, self-organising according to an accumulative logic and creating a chaos of interfaces, such as the tax haven of the Seychelles, in order to cover its actions.As nonhuman intelligences following their own intrinsic logic, the sentience of palms and Money produce different landscapes. While the palms break free from scripts and fallibly experiment in their search for new paths, marking the landscape with signs such as the mysterious coconut they produce, Money acts as a tool of measure and rationalisation, preoccupied with shielding every interface, or node, of its survival network, leaving little or no trace.Through the signs left behind by palms and calculating facades of Money, INTERFACE CHAOS explores forces and intensities, doors and membranes, entries and exits. The screening will be followed by a conversation with the artist hosted by Evening Class, touching on the themes of chaos, nonhuman sentience and survival interfaces, and by a Q&amp;A with the audience."

For many, this is not a problem - we should be tolerant of the beliefs of others. After all, these beliefs are about things that we can’t prove or disprove and don’t really affect what happens in our society.Anarchists believe differently. Just as we reject other ‘masters’ such as the bosses or the State, so we reject any belief that looks towards an external authority for what to believe and how to live. In addition, these beliefs very much do affect society, e.g. views on abortion, homosexuality, race. Throughout history people have used religion as a justification to oppress others, often with extreme violence, e.g. the slave trade, the Crusades and ISIS today.But how do we argue against religious beliefs? It is especially difficult when these beliefs are held by persecuted minorities and people we are working with in unions and community campaigns. This meeting will consider why anarchists reject religion, then invite participants to join a discussion about what strategies we can adopt to challenge religion in our society."

Yet mental health must be seen and understood within the overall body of society and as a question that concerns all. In Other Ways to Care I (http://programme.antiuniversity.org/id/other-ways-to-care-beyond-the-neo-liberal-madness) we explored alternatives models that advocate for a recognition of the social-political dimensions of mental health care and a general move towards deinstitutionalisation and de-psychiatrisation of mental illness.In Others Ways to Care II, we want to make alliances with activist and social movements and position the problems of mental illness within wider social, political and labour struggles.We propose to organise a one-day gathering of activist and activist’s organisations, representatives of mental health movements, community organisers, patient organisations, mental health workers and others, to share experiences, militant tactics, grassroots knowledge and solidarity actions.Participating groups and individuals will be invited to work collaboratively to form the event and develop contributions that are diverse in format, including but not limited to presentations, workshops, music, film or poetry so that people might best represent themselves and share their insight. We will conclude the day with a communal meal outside the Arts Catalyst space.Mental health is a common good which concerns all. We thus need to construct a field of action that is collective and diverse and explore counter-hegemonic ideas of mental health which oppose neo-liberal interests. This event seeks to be the precursor to future events, so that collaboration and solidarity can be sought by all struggling to provide and receive care."

The four of us who run it will each do a 5-10 minute reading/performance around the function of Reading Room, and we will hold an open mic for anyone else to contribute a reading or speak their thoughts.The launch would be open to the public, as well as everyone who contributed content via our open call - most of whom have no other connection to us or each other. We want this event to connect everyone, focusing on the human/community element of small press and addressing issues around circulation and reach. Our own performances and the content available to read will hopefully spark further discussion."

Sharing the principles of co-operation, self-organisation and mutual aid, social centres are organised non-hierarchically, and offer a physical space and resources to activist groups and grassroots campaigns working towards social change.In this guided tour, co-facilitated by members of the Social Centres Network, we will visit some of the centres currently operating in London, pass by buildings that used to be such spaces, and collectively imagine the kind of spaces that we would like to see open in the years to come. We will walk, take public transport (when needed), share food and drinks, look out for one another, and go at the group’s pace. All welcome; parents with young children especially welcome.

Students will be able to articulate the theories that underpin a particular performance piece that they have created, remaining immersed in the practicalities of the art alongside the crucial reflection on the thought processes that underpin it. A key term within this course is ‘Interdisciplinary’ art.Activism: A global meaning of activism is culturally and academically embedded within the module design and delivery, thus locating an opportunity to elicit an engaged participation from those familiar with the tools and cognitive frameworks (such as semantics and visual signposts) of both oppressed and oppressor. The term ‘Activism’ also aligns to other anthropological types of religious application. Students will collaborate on an education based performance workshop around the theme of activism."

The session will be structured as an introductory talk followed by individual and group work becoming familiar with the major arcana and practicing readings.The workshop is suitable for total beginners and the curious as well as more experienced readers interested in discussing approaches to the major arcana.In my own practice I find tarot useful, not so much for telling the future, but as a process of telling stories about a given situation, our desires and patterns of behaviour. Readings can draw attention to things we may have missed in our planning or understanding. This is the sprit in which I will approach the workshop although participants may find their own angles and processes.You are encouraged to bring their own deck if you have one.

This will then be used in combination with short form creative writing exercises to enable our computer voices to speak collectively.The voice offers a tool with which to think through the wider issues about our emerging relationships with AIs. Speaking has become a common means of interaction with AI software and holding a conversation with a synthesised voice is a familiar trope via smartphone and home assistants. At the same time, our human voice is deeply tied to our physical bodies, with different mouth, throat and diaphragm shapes producing different voice pitch and harmonics. When the two intersect and we allow an AI to ‘borrow our voice’, we open a window to think about AI’s embodiment or lack of it. We also begin to think about the hybridity enacted by deep learning systems that are trained on enormous amounts of our personal data.In the workshop we will be using a web-based service called Lyrebird.

      "description"      : "Vitruvian Man, Leonardo’s perfectly proportioned human based on the recommendations of a Roman architect who thought that strong and stable (and beautiful) buildings would guarantee a strong and stable state, still provides the template for architectural design. What this suggests is not only that the built environment is designed to privilege able bodied white males but that architecture is, in itself, inherently political. This seminar will address the politics of space from the position of critical posthumanism in which Vitruvian Man stands for the exemplary human that no body can approximate. If we entertain the idea that we have never been human, then new possibilities emerge for thinking the politics of the social as it is constructed in urban space."

We will be looking at the recycling of language – re-ing language. The differences that emerge when language is re-enacted-peated-constructed.Using writing as an experimental making tool we will model and mould language we encounter in this site, turning an every day act into a writing residency. Viewing writing in its broadest sense, as not only word on paper, but as enactment, as performance, as movement, as communication. Writing as freezing a moment in time - committing it to memory.This is a collective exercise of producing together, rapidly and inclusively.After the residency we will be forming a publication from the material we have generated that will be shared afterwards.****No writing expertise is needed, everyone is welcome. ‘Non-writers’ encouraged! ****Please bring a drink bottle as the circle line can get quite stuffy."

Here&#39;s an example—Blue-sky thinking, nounMonth after month I hoped to harvest that bright void. I held on through the winter, praying for the upturn, completing audits, developing my profile to the bleat of these relentless machines. Then finally, one wet spring morning, rushing to a meeting, there it was—caught in a circle of rain on the tarmac—a patch of blue. I craned my neck, eager. If only I could say my vision sharpened, my heart sang, my faculties unfurled … what could anyone feel faced with that sudden, cold emptiness, but the poverty of labour and the meagreness of love, and the calm, last promise of oblivion?"

Year after year is the hottest on record and in the UK 1 in every 14 people are using food banks while children eat out of bins. We need our children to be tough, confident, kind, loving, happy and skilful, because they&#39;re the only ones who can get us out of the mess we&#39;re in.   But our society&#39;s childcare is not up to the task. Nursery staff are terribly paid and terribly undervalued, there is a crisis in places, staff turnover means children cannot form the attachment relationships they so badly need, and parents have to spend all their wages in order to leave them there.  We are setting up a different model of childcare - cooperative nurseries - because we believe Early Years provision should be:  free open to all stable nurturing of physical and mental health designed to help children become confident, happy, kind, loving and tough child centred well paid and well respected at the centre of our communities educating children about the state of the world empowering children to take action  What does an alternative strategy for early years provision look like? What would it mean to run our own nurseries in our local communities? In this session we will discuss how to push forward with the ideas and demands from 8 March Mums on Strike events. We will run a Stay and Play and make space to chat while we sing and play. "

Every day, all over the world, we care for others: we cook, shop, clean, chaperone, comfort, listen organise…….the list is endless.  We do this for those we love: our kids, partners, parents, friends, neighbours. This tiring, repetitive hard work is unpaid and often Unseen. It’s our work that reproduces humans, keeps the world turning and profits flowing. But our care work can also empower us, for through caring we learn how to understand and support one another.Taking inspiration from Italian feminist Balbo (1987) who describes women&#39;s care work ‘as the sorting, piecing and patching together of goods and services into a crazy quilt’, in this participatory workshop we will share our lived experience of care work, from the making of meals and homes, to the emotional work of responding to others needs.Together we will make quilts to explore the different dimensions of care in the context of an increasingly individualised society which punishes carers, examining the good and the bad, what empowers and disempowers us.Our objective is to identify alternatives to current corporate child and social care provision, which is amongst the most expensive in the world, explore dilemmas and formulate our demands for good, fair and empowering care work."

And what if we could fully experience the critic of the affect as well as its representation as a place for social peace? Modern Ace---If the first broadcast was about mixing original content from invited artists who were participating to a marathon of emotions, the second broadcast went through several constitutive moments of the ductile and affective story of Françoise.  The year the a new radio play trilogy will conclude this series by re-editing a known work ‘The Decameron from Giovanni Boccaccio’. Instead of rebuilding its matrix, it will be about excessively commenting on each part in order to recreate the discourses which are present in the stories and which guide this work. It is as if the foot notes would become the main page and the main text would become a pretext for the reader and listener to comprehend the contemporary production of meaning of this collection of stories.

      "description"      : "Museums tell stories, the stories of the people in power and their established structures. As institutions destined for elite and scholars since their conception, museums have (mainly) told the stories of their collections through text. Although this has started to change in recent years, text in the form of panels and labels are often the only source of interpretation of artefacts and artworks. Who is writing these stories and with what type of language? How biased or objective is it? How can the people experiencing the institution can relate to and understand this written interpretation and its hidden nuances of production?For this workshop in the galleries of Tate Modern we will take on the label, the text, the word and the image. Facilitated by the members of Museum Club, a collective of museum professionals dedicated to demystifying the museum, participants will be led through a series of exercises in writing gallery text from a variety of perspectives, including their own. Through discussion we hope to unlock the social potential of the museum by un-learning the established structure of language that has constructed our experience of art in the museum for too long."

      "description"      : "Care is a fundamental practice of human life, where vulnerability and interconnectedness has the potential to resist the dominance of neoliberalism. Care exists in different contexts manifesting in both personal and private realms, to broader institutional sources. In an age of austerity, state-provided care has diminished in all sectors, but does this material scarcity also extend to an emotional scarcity? By exploring both the affective and material modes of care we hope to map the different ways individuals and communities give and receive care, and the asymmetries that exist. We want to think about how we experience care in different spaces from the domestic, to the workplace, to explore how we can make care an imperative political demand.By the end of the workshop we hope to geographically and affectively map both our own individual understanding of care and extend this to where we see the absences of care in our daily experiences. We will then use these reflections to discuss how we can conceptualise what a radical community of care could look like. By comparing our maps, to those produced by autonomous communities formed in Athens, we can learn from practices of care performed in different political contexts and spaces."

We will meet at Yurt Café and walk to the boat moored nearby.Capitalist Realism was published one year after the 2008 financial crisis, when it became clear that the priority was to return to business-as-usual, rather than tackle the systemic failure of the financial sector. Mark Fisher’s book was a desperate attempt to question the unshakable belief that “there is no alternative” to capitalism and thereby introduce alternative conceptions of social organisation into public discourse. In chapters 4-5 he unpicks the failures of neoliberalism in education and employment, highlighting the concomitant rising levels of anxiety and depression.Fisher emphasises that capitalism requires our complicity in order to function, that we effectively endorse capitalism through our actions rather than our convictions, and that far from being a radical practice, anti-capitalist critique is a feature of capitalism. He argues that we have transitioned from a traditional disciplinary regime to a society of decentralised control; where control is internalised in self-assessment and self-surveillance.What contradictions do we face in our labour and creative practices? How can we respond productively to these contradictions in our everyday life?For more information, to download the text and book your place please visit our website."

      "description"      : "How can we think about and understand voice? What does it mean to say that someone has &#39;found their voice&#39;? Does voice mean the same to artists as it does to journalists or researchers? Do we all possess an &#39;authentic&#39; voice? What or who else speaks through and for us? Should we imagine and adopt the voices of others? How are voices disciplined and silenced? What voices do madness and knowledge and science and art and education speak in?We would like to draw a conversation about these questions. At the event, artists, researchers and others will speak for three to five minutes each. When you book a ticket you can indicate whether you would like to speak for three to five minutes too.You don&#39;t have to speak, but if you would like to, we will send you a copy of a book in advance so that you have something to respond to. It is called Multivoices: a script by researchers and prompted our questions. Some of the writers in the book deal with problems stemming from hierarchy and power in education and research. We would like to see if this &#39;script&#39; is relevant in other areas.We don&#39;t know what will be taught or learnt or discussed as a result of the session. It might not join up or conclude. We hope you will leave having encountered enough perspectives for the questions to stay with you.

We are inviting people who are interested to discuss what evaluation can be when it comes to creative practices and intangible experiences.We aim to discuss an experimental way to evaluate, being aware of intangibilities. The art field can be very impaired by the way evaluation takes place. Base on the experience of educational programmes for arts, this workshop wants to create a debate about a consistent way to evaluate without follow the traditional methods.“Evaluation is boring and sometimes not honest” “Do you feel honest when you are evaluating?” Who is your evaluation for? How do you deal with surveys? Do you feel your practice doesn’t fit inside of this very systematic and pragmatic way of evaluation? Which tools do you think would feed your needs?We will invite people for a conversation based on evaluation. Asking few questions and giving new meanings to complex configurations established by this subject, through an experimental process, the participants will have the opportunity to debate ideas and thoughts, creating a manual and learning in a collaborative and experimental way.*Inspired by the book Teaching for people who prefer not to teach "

Many people feel let down by politicians creating negative experiences, alienating them from democratic processes that should exist to help them. This leads to apathy and conclusions like &#39;they are all as bad as each other&#39; or &#39;nothing ever changes&#39;. I am researching how families could improve learning about democracy and lead social change together.The first part of this workshop will be a chance to discuss some of the challenges and inequalities in our political system, sharing experiences and opinions on political education as well as imagining how things could be better.We will then be experimenting with photovoice, a research method that uses photography to answer questions, to explore how political decision-making impacts on physical spaces, the family and everyday life. This may involve going outside and using camera phones to capture images.(Please note that this workshop is not part of our formal research. Although the conversations may influence our thinking, we will not be gathering any formal evidence. The aim is rather to learn together, share ideas, methods and thinking.)"

Accompanying the structure will be a collection of creative writing from women exploring themes of solitude, sanctuary, stability and individuality in the context of living in the city.Women are paradoxically expected to provide solidity, structure and sanctuary whilst they disproportionately experience unstable positions in housing, work and society. In response, the shed will prompt participants to consider the necessity and availability of physical shelter and time alone in urban environments whilst showcasing women&#39;s’ experiences of [or lack of] solitude, self identity and self-reliance.We will be building the shed (everyone welcome to help!) in May, and collecting writing from now up until our event on the 9th June when we will invite the public to discover the project. We will host a picnic, sing traditional folk tunes, encourage participants to add to the writing and celebrate the women of the city.

      "description"      : "It used to be easy to define poetry. You just needed a few daffodils, a starving aesthete in a garret dying of consumption, and the opportunity to go somewhere and wander about a lot. Now there is the threat of open warfare in the poetry world, where the ‘spoken worders’ don’t get the ‘on the pagers’ and vice versa. To rhyme or not to rhyme, that could be the question.Before we get to exchanging ink pellets across the lecture hall floor I think we first of all need to understand what poetry is – a concept that increasingly defies definition. So, this session is concerned precisely with that – coming up with a definition of poetry that will satisfy everyone. Easy peasy. After that we can begin to measure and debate the legitimacy of all sides of the argument.This session is open to fishermen, midwives, shopkeepers, chimney sweeps, football pundits, anyone in fact that has an opinion on this. It is also open to musicians and artists and, reluctantly, to poets, though they are not encouraged, as they will bring too much baggage with them and start spouting on about stuff."

It is considered a brain disease because humankind changes the earth—they change its structure and how it works.Soft Sickness is a one day workshop hosted by the research project Shift Register (http://shiftregister.info/) exploring the signs, symptoms, circulations, exchanges, consumptions, dependencies, and management implicit in the multifarious and pathological dependence on the earth which is now named by that word “Anthropocene”. Earthly addictions produce quantified-earth self-portraiture, GIS co-dependencies, and all other variants of planetary narcissism. Earth-scale sensor systems and media networks, swathing the planet in information about itself, are unveiled with media from on- and off-planet earth science field-stations and reflections thereupon. Dependencies bring anxieties about the impending doom of resource dearths to come.During the workshop, participants and invited guests will discuss, map, extract, ingest and excrete relations of local earth manifested in Finsbury Park in North London. We will gather psycho-active dew, imagine tales for the mole people, bake bread for crows, and make the earthworlds flesh."

The subject of the day’s capture and transmogrification will be the endless procession of series and films with law enforcement as protagonist(s).During the periods of waiting inherent to hand-made 16mm filmmaking processes, we will hear briefly about the historical development of policing in the UK and the US in relationship to slavery and capitalism, connect with contemporary struggles against police violence, and discuss the possibility of breaking through dominant media imaginaries to envision a world without cops via community-based alternative justice strategies and DIY photochemical filmmaking."

Do they sense different choices in different ways?The workshop will give a technical overview of machine learning processes. The participants are invited to use imagination and speculate about how algorithms channel information, asking what kind of worlds this technology could create. The coming world will not just be made of technical explanations but also creative understandings.

These parallel discussions will each be convened by an educator working with a particular subject focus/concern in/with the current arts education system, and include the participation of an undefined group of interested individuals.The open meeting will be the first in a series of meetings that will cumulatively configure a propositional model of arts education that sits distinct from existing models of the alternative art school, which are arguably bound to the circulatory confines of the art world and are therefore serving a market-driven economy rather than an education-led ecology.

It is not necessary to explain to people how much the Mexican worldview has influenced the world, at least in the western. In the early years of the 20th century, the relation between engraving and the ease of passing this around was an important tool for revolutionary ideals and of course, a way to put art in public spaces and the public sphere. This has been a deep root in the street art of Mexico, and in different parts of the USA, which has had a big influence from Mexican culture.The main problem was to get, as in other processes, access to the means of production. For a lot of different techniques we found it necessary to get space, tools and sometimes heavy and expensive machinery.The idea of guerrilla is the transformation of the ideas in our brain to create new ways and processes to develop and achieve an aim, which commonly we can only do in workshops. Guerrilla is the way to get the things you need by yourself. It is a way to create the spaces, tools and machinery we need for our artistic practices."

We steam in with guns blazing on the attack or we are so fearful of confrontation that we run away or pretend it’s not happening. We move back and forth from stress to craving and habitual patterns. If we can learn a more skilful way of responding, through meditation and movement, then we can apply that learning in our day to day lives. Not reacting with stress or anger, but listening and yielding so that then we are able to respond with wisdom and compassion. Then we can come to a place of fresh intelligence. Then we truly know how to be.Join Sue McAlpine in this workshop of meditation and movement to explore through body and mind another relationship with negative emotions."

He was the first to incorporate the body into psychoanalysis.Along the way, he broke with Freud, practiced radical biology, fought fascism, founded his own discipline of alternative physics, and fled to the US.In the US his radical ideas brought him into conflict with the authorities and he was eventually jailed, dying in prison in 1957. He is the only person whose books were burnt by both the Nazis and the US government.This talk will look at his life and work and assess what he can take from his profound legacy."

At stake were the future direction of the institution and the definition of education itself. The events made national headlines but were for decades treated as taboo and written out of the official history of the University.The documentary project, &#39;Mustard: Knowledge for What?&#39; weaves together a series of filmed life story interviews with participants, archival documents from both the &#39;official&#39; institution and the Free University, the perspectives of current students and staff, and contemporary media reports.The result is anything but a neat, coherent story about the protestors themselves, germ warfare, freedom of speech, the right and/or obligation to protest, the growing pains of an institution, and the struggles to define the structure and role of any university within the wider contexts of national and global student activism in 1968.

Looking at the chain stores and bad labour practices that are entrenched in the market today it’s hard to imagine this could have been the case. Never mind the trendy artisan take on the coffeehouse. But there is historic evidence that there was a time when cafés ‘fired the flames of dissent’.In the 17th and 18th century a certain type of café became known as a Penny University and provided a space for alternative education some of which was intensely rebellious. As we tour the historical sites in and around the City of London, I argue that the notion of the Penny University is of crucial importance in a world where education is becoming ever more commodified and learning more strictly controlled by the status quo. This tour is in memory of my father, Bob Biderman, who both wrote about and loved cafes and sadly died earlier this year.

When we wear clothes that speak we have more conversations about things that matter to us, with strangers and friends alike.When we make an artefact to accompany a march, campaign or movement we keep a piece of that with us even after the assemblies and demonstrations are over. When people can be inspired to use and repair clothing with a sense of strength and solidarity, conversations about what it means to own and to use materials can begin.This, in the face of current neoliberal ideologies and our fast fashion culture, is a radical act in itself.Materials will be provided, and there will be some clothing on offer (donations are welcome but not necessary), but we recommend that people bring their favourite or least favourite garment to be temporarily or permanently adorned. The usual materials used include paint and markers, coloured cloth tape, patches which have been screen printed using selected positive words. Sewing machines, with expert guidance and coaching.We have started doing readings at events also, so people can listen while working.Take a look at the site for an idea of the usual output from our workshops.Recently we have been supporting the pickets at UCL, St Marys and the student occupations.

The score was defined by the theoretical research and textile pieces or costumes which became the threads of conversation.For Antiuniversity Now festival, the artist will bring costumes, textile works, and theoretical questions to London; she wants to continue her research together with participants. Questions may include: Does a process of identifying others&#39; action differ from a process of identifying an own(ed) action? How far can one forget self to be able to connect with another self? Under what conditions can fabric become dress, and vice versa?The workshop is open to all who are interested in the topics and like to work in groups.

This hands-on symbol development workshop investigates.Alchemy is a confidence trick, parting rich patrons from their funding, hence obliquely transmuting base metals into gold. Real magic. Thus alchemy is also class war: a redistributive inversion of the expropriation of surplus value. Yet alchemy is also a process for transmuting the self and its action upon the world. Like psychoanalysis, it achieves this through the manipulation of cognitive symbol mechanics. Rather than simply interpreting dreams, however, the point is to change them.Magic is about bringing the unconscious and imposed patterns that shape thoughts and actions into alignment with autonomous will - or as Engels put it, freedom is the recognition of necessity. Somewhere between Oblique Strategies, Tarot and Collective Self-Help, we experiment with hacking these patterns, through the manipulation of symbolic resonances.The open question is how to develop this process as a practical tool for egalitarian social transformation."

For many people, this is not a problem - we should be tolerant of the beliefs of others. After all, these beliefs are about things that we can’t prove or disprove and don’t really affect what happens in our society.Anarchists believe differently. Just as we reject other ‘masters’ such as the bosses or the State, so we reject any belief that looks towards an external authority for what to believe and how to live. In addition, these beliefs very much do affect society, e.g. views on abortion, homosexuality, gender and race.Throughout history people have used religion as a justification to oppress others, often with extreme violence, e.g. the slave trade, the Crusades and ISIS today.But how do we argue against religious beliefs? It is especially a problem when these beliefs are held by persecuted minorities and people who we are working within unions and community campaigns. This discussion meeting will consider why anarchists reject religion and then open up the discussion about what strategies we can adopt for challenging religion in our society."

      "title"    : "Other Ways to Care beyond the Neo-liberal Madness ",
      "description"      : "In recent years, it has become very clear that the mental cannot just be described from the psychiatric or psychological perspective alone: it has become a disputed and financialised object, constant prey to quantification, mapping and measurement, where diagnostic tools and clinical descriptions are increasingly influenced by the pressures to medicalise psychiatry, and are subject to the powerful interests of psychopharmacological therapeutics, as well as governmental and private insurancelogics.As much as nature, the mental has become an object of resource extraction. At the same time, what we refer to as care is also undergoing massive transformations. It is increasingly reduced to psychological-physical dimensions and abstracted from any social, urban, economic, work-based context. This has contributed to its progressive deterritorialisation from spaces of existence and lifepractices. The person is left, feeling to blame and shouldering the responsibility for their mental wellbeing.More complex ideas and practices emerging during the Second World War and post war years were at the forefront of important reforms in psychiatric care in Europe. We can refer to Institutional Psychotherapy in France, Psichiatria Democratica in Italy, and the social psychiatry and therapeutic community movement in the UK. For different reasons, they either remain to some extent neglected, side-lined or hidden from history.What is the value and potential of these programmes of healthcare and conceptions of mental illness today?Through the presentation of case studies, readings and discussion, the workshop will attempt to examine some of the theoretical underpinnings, differences and similarities of such approaches, their evolving practices and methods, and formulate ideas around their use to trigger the imagination of other ways to care that go beyond the neo-liberal project."

It has been a protest tactic used against landlord at least as far back as the 1900s.Rent strikes are stories of extraordinary collective resistance, of radical community organising, glimmers of hope in the dark sordid history of capitalism and the exploitation of the working class.They are a realisation of collective power and a reminder that the force of change lies in the hands of the people.Sometimes used to support a general strike and other wider struggles, rent strikes have been instrumental in changing legislation around housing and tenants’ rights.The talk will take a look at rent strikes throughout history, and will hear from organisers of UCL Cut the Rent, London Renters Union and ACORN."

How might this help us think with more clarity, widen our imagination, makes us feel content, alive and connected?In this session the movements of the everyday will become our inspiration.

In spite of this apparent abundance of artistic self-expression, the rise of nationalism and the right reveals that many people are feeling disenfranchised and voiceless. These are battles about culture, cultural identity as well as the future of democratic politics. If culture is part of what is at stake then surely cultural policy has a role to play in countering the divisiveness of the narratives that underpin current political developments? So the question is what can culture do? And how can we cultivate a contemporary culture, together, that is by all and for all?This discussion will invite key speakers who are working on a grass-roots level to nurture culture in all its manifestations, to overcome toxic cultural hierarchies and realise a society where the resources to make culture are more equitably shared to tell us about the work they are doing. We will then form working groups to map out cultural policies that would build towards a more democratic, equal and more radically inclusive cultural landscape."

In deliberately confounding the apparently smooth interface through which digital messages are received, the glitch aesthetic suggests a productive imagery for a politics which confronts the hierarchies embedded in and reproduced by digital culture.This event is part of the Culture, Power &amp; Politics seminar series organised by Jeremy Gilbert and the Centre for Cultural Studies Research at the University of East London."

However, instead of identifying as many species as possible or hunting down an migrating rarity, the objective will be to explore the radical examples set by birds, and to reframe birdwatching as an act that, while not revolutionary in itself, is one worthy of anyone who wants to build a better world (or just turn their back on the one we have already messed up).For all recorded history people have projected their hopes, fears and existential rubbish onto birds, and sought to crowbar out of them a profound understanding of the human world. As flawed and whimsical as this oulook might undoubtedly is, the premise of this walk/talk is that revolutionaries, radicals, utopians and truck-burners can do the same.The precise content of the walk will be based (very) loosely on the wildlife we encounter, but it will more than likely include references to class war, the disestablishment of nation states, polyamory, Peter Kropotkin, Silver Mt Zion and direct action tactics. And as the walk/talk will be firmly participatory, I would welcome others&#39; contributions/interjections, too.Knowledge of British breeding birds is not required. To be honest, I&#39;d prefer you forget any you have as it will probably interfere with my own half-baked hypothesising.And I have to admit the content is not what most would consider suitable for children."

I&#39;ve been feeling pressure to do with the language I use to express myself, a language which comes from a heteronormative, patriarchal discourse.I don&#39;t mind children, really. But what I mind is a logic of compulsive, reproductive futurity, which seems to permeate everything and control my life, even when I walk down the pavement.My stance is this: The problem is not that people are having babies. The problem is that having babies creates a logic that refuses to be superseded – a logic that compels us to consider ourselves in relation (and only in relation) to it; it compels us to define ourselves in relation to it and to make decisions around our lives alongside it. The logic that having babies gives rise to shapes who we are; this logic sets the term of the discussion, which impose an ideological limit to other life narratives and which renders unthinkable anything beyond it. What would it mean not to fight for children, but to fight for oneself? How could one take the other side or to abolish sides all together? And do we need to answer the question: if not this, then what? Do we have to make sense only in relation to a future defined by children?Blame the narcissists that do not want to have children!Blame the hedonists that do not want to have children!Blame the selfish, for not wanting to have children!But if this is what narcissism is, then I want to be narcissistic, I want to be hedonistic, I want to be selfish.Down PRONATALISMDOWN PRONATALISMDOWN PRONATALISMEVERYONE TOGETHERDONW PRONATALISMDOWN PAEDOCRACYDOWN PAEDOCRACYDOWN PAEDOCRACYWE WANT ACROBATICS, WE WANT SEX ACROBATICS, WE DO NOT WANT PROCREATIVE SEX, JUST ACROBATICSI want to think and to write about these things.

Climate change is one of the most significant problems which the world faces yet because of its massive and diffuse nature approaches to dealing with it are caught in a miasma of differal and avoidance.The recognition that cars and plane travel is fundamentally changing the weather and temperature, and in turn causing the melting of the polar ice caps to cause sea levels to rise is scant.  There is a cognitive dissonance about the lifestyle people feel they have a right to in the west and the acknowledgement that we are moving towards massive global upheaval because of consumer desires and convenience wants.  In many respects climate change isn’t about saving the planet but it is about us and our vulnerability to a level of climate disruption civilisation has never seen.The massive industrialisation of beef and dairy herds has shaped behaviours such that meat and dairy seem to feature in nearly every single meal.  This production of so many head of cattle is resulting in the damaging of the environment through the sheer amount of methane which cows produce. Methane is between 28 and 34 times more potent than the equivalent amount of CO2 making the propensity to eat meat a significant contributor to climate change because of the production of greenhouse gasesThinking about this in equitable terms is pivotal.  It will not be the rich who suffer first but the poorest.  Places like Bangladesh are most vulnerable and will be hit the hardest by sea level rises.  This in turn will reduce the amount of land on which people can live and farm causing the displacement of millions of people who will move into other countries for survival.More extreme winters and summers are resulting and weather patterns become altered.  Understanding the impact of our multiple cheap flights to holiday on the continent means imagining what happens if the gulf stream changes then the temperature of Scotland will drop to the temperatures of Moscow in Russia.  Storms and winds become more eratic and many animal species will suffer along with plant species which are not adapted to the extremes.The United Nations brought together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to accumulate the science and research the problems we are collecitvely facing. What it requires is the collected awareness and behavioural change of human beings if we are to prevent impending tragedies and catastrophies from happening.Prof Kevin Anderson is deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and does not mince his words when discussing the magnitude of the issues we face.  This talk he gives is a good and clear analysis of the flawed nature of how the climate change problem is being conceptualised and approached.  This event is about having a discussion on what people think about the issues and what might be done in response to the crisis.We will be watching a presentation made by Kevin in Denmark which addresses the facts of climate change and prompts the rethinking of how climate change is collectively being approached.Come along and join the discussion after the screening of Kevin Anderson’s presentation"

More than a third of our land is still owned by the aristocracy, whose ancestors seized it during the Norman Conquest.By fencing off land and using violence to exclude people, landowners have deprived the rest of us of what should be a shared resource. The vast majority of us own little or nothing. Even the land that was once meant to be common land has been taken away from us.Land issues lie at the heart of so much inequality and environmental degradation in society today. Landowners are able to control and exploit our natural resources and force the rest of us to be beholden to them for food, shelter and other needs. Despite their huge wealth, our taxes are used to pay landowners millions in farming subsidies and housing benefit, increasing inequality still further.How can we fight for land rights in the UK, if we do not have complete information about who owns what in England and Wales?Guy Shrubsole will present his research on land ownership in England, providing us with the ammunition to fight for land justice."

Her text deals with the &#39;amnesia&#39; displayed by many radical critiques of social anthropology concerning the Manchester School of which Max Gluckman was a founding member.In particular her paper focuses on the seminal essay by MG &#39;The Bridge: Analysis of Social Situation in in Zululand&#39;.The images in the film mainly consist of photos Max and Mary Gluckman took in Zululand and Barotseland between 1938 and 1940.

Not enough women’s clothing has functional pockets, but that doesn’t mean we have to live without them.Bring your clothes that you wish had pockets and we can provide the materials, tools or a helping hand (whichever you need) to add them. Whether a hidden, in-seam pocket, or decorative patch pocket; somewhere to put your hands, or your phone, or a good luck charm; make your existing clothes serve you better.Through this practical workshop we want to open a conversation about work/utility wear and the possibilities of feminism as functional clothing. If more women’s clothing had pockets, would we still carry bags? Would we still be the ones with the tissues, the lip balm, the painkillers and the snacks? How does having pockets free us or influence us?We also hope to share the skills and confidence which allow us to take ownership of our clothing, reducing the need to buy new and providing an alternative way to engage with the fashion system.(All welcome, no previous experience necessary. )"

You can pick a theme title from your head or from a list, create your mind-map and start experimenting with different media and maybe even create a “final piece”.This is a drop-in event from 3pm-8pm taking place in my modest sized studio.

Has it been effective? What have we lost?

That has been a deep root of the street art in Mexico, and in different parts of the USA, which had a big influence of Mexican culture.The main problem was to get, as in any other process, the access to the means of production, for a lot of different technics we found is necessary to get space, tools and sometimes heavy and expensive machinery.The idea of guerrilla is the transformation of the ideas in our brain to create new ways and processes to develop and achieve aim which commonly we can o only in proper workshops.

Body Revolution sets out on a journey that revolutionizes the understanding of what the body is and does. The body is not a fixed and bounded object, but an open process of experiencing and becoming. This event reassesses the power of our body to create reality; it aims to raise awareness of our body as embodiment of the world, which we can unravel, change, and reweave through new physical and sensorial experiences. Our body is our primary condition of existence and free resource given by nature. And nature asks us to sense our own body, to feel it, to listen to its becoming, and to apply its creative intelligence, which breaks through the illusions of separateness between self and world, between being a consumer and a producer of reality. This talk introduces the paradigm of embodiment, drawing on the publication &quot;Giving Birth to Ourselves: The Genesis of Abundance&quot;, and presents how this paradigm has been creatively applied to the city of London, in the performance art project: &quot;Make My Skin: Intimate Regeneration of the City&quot;."

From blues to jazz, reggae to Afrobeat, many artists have used their gifts to offer social commentary and solidarity in opposition to injustice and oppression across the world. Be it Billy Holidays’ “Strange Fruit”, Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, Fela Kuti’s “Zombie” or John Coltrane’s “Alabama”. However the civil rights struggle was not limited to the US. Despite African people being whitewashed from the official history of human rights in the UK, many British based artists have also contributed to the struggle with tracks from acts such as Steel Pulse and their “Ku Klux Klan” to Des’ree’s ode to standing firm with “I Ain’t Moving”. Whilst this story may not be told in British schools, it is archived in the many songs, films, poetry and literature of that period. Musvism is a fun and educational presentation using conscious music from across Africa, the US, the Caribbean and Britain to chart the route of socio-political activism across many eras and genres.

      "description"      : "Cosmology as a science began exactly 100 years ago with Einstein’s first paper applying General Relativity to the entire Universe. This is an audacious attempt to apply a radical idea to something of monumental philosophical importance. Cosmologists seek to use observation, combined with mathematics, to understand fundamental questions related to the origin, composition, growth, and fate of the entire Universe. In the last 20 years cosmology has gone from speculation to precision science, and humanity has learned amazing things about the size and composition of the Universe that were previously the realm of science fiction. This is thanks largely to observations of the “cosmic microwave background radiation”. I will describe advances in modern cosmology relating to theories of the size and origin of the Universe and Dark Matter, and how these theories are grounded in observational facts. The progress of cosmology has been collaborative, and also full of interaction and debate among competing ideas. I will try and describe the human story behind these advances as an example of the scientific method, and what they might mean for us all. I will attempt to debunk the idea that theoretical physicists hold dearly to &quot;paradigms&quot;, and that on the contrary the field is open to all ideas expressed with sufficient clarity, rigour, and evidence."

Right up to the 1960s the English drug scene was almost entirely West End based; myths/misinformation pushed by MSM will be challenged. 1916: Britain’s first anti-drug (cocaine) law resulted from fears based on lurid tales of sex-workers robbing doped soldiers. 1920:  laws codified on the back of explicitly racist (anti-Chinese), homophobic and anti-Feminist tropes in MSM – mostly about the West End scene. We’ll go to haunts of scene players to reimagine those events.The British drug scene – tiny as it was – was still based there up to the 1960s when there were still only a tiny number of registered – and actual – drug dependent users (compared with e.g. America). Thanks to Rolleston’s enlightened 1926 report.We’ll be walking with quotes from eminent writers, musicians and artists e.g. de Quincey/Crowley/ Greene/Self/Townshend /Bacon who were part of Bohemian scenes. Of special interest: the role of nightlife in this narrativeAnalyses of substance use/abuse should be linked to its environment: how have politicians, police and courts responded?

The overall workshop is designed to encourage risk, fluidity, precision and spontaneity to the stories we tell and the manner in which we create them. The workshop takes place two weeks before Walpole Tidal Pool turns 80 years old, so will additionally be a homage to a place and the many eyes/lenses/senses that it is lived through.

She recognizes herself and sees the strata and the suppleness of her skin as delightful, desperate and erotic; a thousand places and times finally understood and demonstrated.This heroin creates links, the connections between places where we belong as objects and our disappearance. This is when the anti-discourse makes the dialectic of the cause and the effect inoperative; the sweet one can be in the drawing room as well as in other locations, she can be at our place as well as at my place. She navigates to enjoy the real at the same position that we use to identify ourselves. This wish to believe in ontology and epistemology as the big political mechanism of our body. In other words; how to create narrative, historical spaces where confusion and clarity don’t depend on a return to the origin but to a  break up of what is inside and outside the body? What distinguishes the organic from the systematic in a biogenetic relation? "

The seductive message of the manifesto itself is unsurprising, and is typical of the glossy promotional media released by other tech companies: We are told that new technologies can facilitate greater social inclusion, foster democratic grassroots political movements, and allow us to be more productive in our labour and leisure. While such media are often renderings of some notional “future” existence, what might they reveal about the ways we delimit our understanding of the present? Additionally, what would have to happen between “now” and “then” for these visions to be fully realised?Manpowertop is a workshop that takes these questions as a starting point, challenging participants to diagnose the power relations in these branded visions of the future. Participants will adopt “troubleshooting” as a critical framework for enquiry, and produce diagrammatic readings of these speculative technologies, the networks they interlink with, and their associated politics of usership. In doing so, we will collectively identify what is left out of these visions, and explore how these omissions might offer an insight into the power relations that exist between users and technological platforms in the present."

We will look at the way they ask questions and how this has an impact on their way of thinking and making judgements. This workshop aims to encourage its participants to think about topics they might feel intimidated by or feel uncomfortable to talk about due to a lack of knowledge/ information (depression, sexual health, LGBT topics, cultural differences etc.). Participants will be encouraged to overcome those barriers by asking direct questions, by learning and sharing. Many people don’t think about how different types of questions can lead to different outcomes. In this workshop we will try to steer a conversation by asking the right kinds of questions, based on a problem we might be trying to solve.

And the iconic Battle of Deptford Broadway (1932) featured Kath Duncan (about whom Ray has written a new book); it led to the first case NCCL (Liberty’s forerunner) defended.Fittingly Deptford is one of the locations where historical sites are keenly contested e.g. the huge Convoys Wharf site. For centuries Deptford was the headquarters of English shipping: iconic tales of Drake and Raleigh happened here; school history has little to say about Colonialism though. 16thC globalization led to Deptford being England’s first BAEM cluster. Deptford Creek is now of great ecological interest where eg 180+ wildflowers have been identified. It is a fine setting for an architectural masterpiece: the Laban College. Other notable stories foregrounded: John Evelyn, diarist and scientist created the first planned garden which was partially wrecked by his tenant Peter the Great studying shipbuilding; gay playwright and agent Marlowe murdered here; the Macmillan sisters pathbreaking educationalists; and Dire Straits who gave (1970s) free concerts from their balconies.

Now Catford has an annual Arts Trail; creativity flourishing and/or gentrification signal? Lewisham boasts fine parks which likewise are subject to many pressures.

We believe any call for free education must acknowledge the vital role rents play in the continuation of the current university system. In this workshop we’re seeking to discuss the relationship between the marketisation of public universities and the drastic increase in student rents since 2009/10. Universities have been in a pissing contest to see who can get the largest property portfolio: paid for by students. If the university is preparing us for our future exploitation, it’s doing an excellent job.Freed from any notion of welfare provision, student accommodation now forms a key component of university privatisation strategies; directly underpinning increases in tuition fees whilst undermining educational access for low to middle income students.Last year over 1,000 rent-striking students at UCL won over £1 million in concessions in the form of compensation, bursaries and rent cuts. Despite eviction threats and attempts to victimise individual students, a collective refusal to be divided or bullied - alongside careful organisation with off-campus groups - forced successive capitulations by managers.Join us to discuss ideas, do some sweet strategising, and plot to win!"

And rising rent, rouge landlords, and the knowledge that we&#39;re giving the majority of our monthly paycheques to the man, makes housing here all the more frustrating and precarious. So what options are there for us to work together to set up sustainable collectively-owned housing in London? This workshop will explore ideas from housing co-operatives, community land trusts, council housing, and more. This workshop will involve presentations, and opportunities for everyone to participate in activities to reimagine our housing.

Nowadays post-modernist architectural icons for the Age of Spectacle can be noted too.This century it’s an area known for fashion industry, TV content providers, art galleries and edgy cutting-edge firms in entertainment sector.

      "description"      : "A chat show with an unusual twist. We invite four seemingly ordinary people on stage to talk about something extraordinary - it will either be something extraordinary that has happened to them, or something extraordinary that they are currently doing. The chat show will have an interesting take on modern life. In an age where people are obsessed with celebrity, we find that television chat shows are mainly used as a vehicle to enhance the participants&#39; brands. So it&#39;s very rare that anything interesting or unusual happens that enlightens an audience. This will be different.It will borrow from podcasts such as &quot;This American Life&quot; and Radio 4&#39;s &quot;Short Cuts&quot; in terms of finding ordinary people with compelling stories that make us examine our existence from a different perspective.  But we won&#39;t completely leave the standard chat show format behind. Along the lines of American chat shows, we will have a guest house band who will play a couple of songs in between guests (They will also do a longer set after the chat show has ended). And we will also have a short stand up comedy routine from an up-and-coming comedian during the course of the show."

Anger is seen part of your madness; complaints will be ignored and invalidated because any criticism on our part is a feature of our delusion. Where do we have a voice or power? Apart from suggesting we need mad culture, I will show how you can use art and humour to educate the wider public of what is really going on in psychiatry; to reclaim control of our narratives and identity; and to respond powerfully to a system that has hurt too many people. Art is way to make resistance impossible to ignore. "

On the 15th the peasant’s demands were met. By November, the king had gone back on his word and 1,500 working people had been slaughtered. Tyler and Ball had been captured and killed.On 12th June 2016, Sheaf+Barley will meet on Blackheath and remember the words of the preacher John Ball, on the same day in 1381: “the time is come, appointed to us by God, in which ye may cast off the yoke of bondage, and recover liberty”. What are our yokes? And how shall we cast them off? How will we unyoke ourselves? What can we learn from the demands of the people, hundreds of years ago?

Topics of Discussion:- Should gender dysphoria be de-pathologised?- If so, are we (transgender people) further marginalising other disabled people- should we be considered disabled? - how does binary and non-binary gender identity fit into gender oppressive matrix?- How do other queer people be better allies to the transgender community?- How do transgender people be better allies to other disabled people?- how does being trans fit into political or collective depression?This workshop will be lead by transpeople (inc. gender questioning, genderqueer) for both trans and cis* people.

Essentially a comic piece. The audience come in small groups of up to 8 people at a time. Each is greeted by the &quot;Dr&quot; as a former patient who has come to assist in the therapy process. Audience members are encouraged to offer opinions and share their own stories, weather real or imagined, with the rest of the &quot;Group&quot;. The focus is ultimately always drawn back to the main patient &quot;It&quot;, and how &quot;It&quot; can be helped. In previous performances audiences responded in as many different ways as there were audience members - some sang &quot;It&quot; a song, some shared intimate stories, group hugs, disgust, anger, fear, laughter. Audiences are asked to help &quot;It&quot; with identity by giving &quot;It&quot; a name, profession, hopes, dreams etc.  This is very-much an &quot;Imersive&quot; semi-improvised piece.&quot;IT&quot; is all about breaking down barriers between strangers.

By existence, we mean both the human lives and experiences, which the estate is home to and the existence of the estate as a structure, and more widely, the existence of these things in a socio-historical context. We are interested in exploring the changes that are being enforced on the residents from many different angles and how these changes sit with the estate&#39;s history. To do this, we attend meetings, talk to residents and engage with the community in diverse ways. As part of highlighting Cressingham Gardens as a place, a core part of the project is to give a platform to residents&#39; own creative responses to the changes happening to their home.The final performance will be largely verbatim, made of residents testimonies and our research collected over the time we spend there. The performance will take place outdoors, on the estate making use of a combination of live performance, sound and video projection. The whole performance will not exceed one hour. "

I’ve chosen the Barbican because, besides being a interesting location visually, the architecture creates points where GPS fails and cannot triangulate a position. These points of failure can help orient us within the GPS network and get a better sense of its limits and capabilities.After the walk, we’ll work with pens and paper to try and document the experience of walk from both a human and satellite point-of-view. This takes it in some speculative directions. How are spaces and places understood by machine infrastructures? What sense can these infrastructures make of space when their sensors fail? What kind of hybrid senses are we developing for ourselves as we rely more and more on our devices?Note: please bring an android device with GPS if you have one. Apple’s iOS does not make this sort of information available from the GPS sensor, so the app does not work on iPhone."

A space for self-reflection and growth which is missing in secular communities. The design of this gathering sits within a larger project called House of Covvens which challenges the outdated, alienating and oppressive nature of the UK’s parliamentary system, looking at how integrating traditionally overlooked ‘feminine’ bodies of knowledge could break down hierarchies, creating a more equal and effective society.Within this system I have imagined that people in society would gather regularly in these ‘Covvens’ and through this alternative approach are able to subvert the current authority and control of the institutional forms of information sharing which are inevitably tailored to sustain the power of those already at the top. It is about the demystification of misconceptions we’ve been fed by these institutions through setting up environments that allow the free sharing of ideas and perspectives and therefore an organic approach to education."

We think Punk is good as it rejects the present. It also allows for the urgent, incompetent, primal channelling of joy and rage. And apparently, there’s only two steps…choose an instrument, and find some like-minded people.For Anti-University this year we invite those willing to step outside known formats, to harness without hindering, to collectively ask how we might do things differently based on a culture of praise, permission and care. To (metaphorically) expose ourselves, to listen and to respond.And, because we don’t know, we want to ask for help, your help.Bands let us embody our politics as they channel everything into what they wear, how they behave, their lyrics, their music, their everything…in short, they open up possibilities. We want to create an atmosphere of permission, where anyone can be involved in any capacity: lyric writing (well or badly), choreographing (well or badly), playing an instrument (well or badly) or customizing the bands overall look (of course, well or badly).We don&#39;t want to run another event that cuts itself off from the world and we don&#39;t want to have another discussion about how all art events are closed off from the general universe.Therefore, we will hold this event in a park, in an amphitheatre, with the hope that people could walk past, join in or watch confusedly - for as much or as little time as they want.We agree with Evan Ifekoya that, “Making a spectacle of oneself is a political act,”* and we wonder how to practically support each other to go beyond and let go and in doing so make a spectacular, political spectacle.We want it to sound like you can hear human beings fingers all over it** and look like nothing that has ever graced or seized Hope Play Space’s ethos ever quite like this before!We imagine a huge, strong, messy, cacophonic band; with multiple drummers, dancers, singers, wavers; someone playing the triangle. People dedicated to getting the crowd psyched, all making noise and shaking themselves at once. Radical content to dance to, speaking what is not spoken, screaming what isn’t heard.

Within academia, reading set texts in private and discussing them in a group is commonplace. However, the curious mechanisms whereby marks on paper have meaning is often left unexplored. Similarly, other ways in which we might &#39;read&#39;, engaging other modes of our being, are underexplored. This workshop will extend the conventional definition of ‘reading’ to include the sense it is used in another context, that of psychic development, where ‘reading’ can also be an act of non-rational, non-verbal expressing of information, where the information is not conventionally codified, and where the information is obtained from non-textual sources, e.g. an object (psychometry) or a person (telepathy). In the workshop we will attempt to ‘read’ texts sealed inside envelopes, invisible to the naked eye.

      "description"      : "This outdoor seminar will follow the form of a guided birdwalk in an inner London park. However, instead of the identification of as many species as possible or hunting down a rare LBJ*, the objective will be to explore the radical examples set by birds, and to reframe birdwatching as a pursuit rich in rewards for anyone with an ounce of revolutionary zeal.For all recorded history people have projected their hopes, fears and existential rubbish onto birds, and sought to crowbar out of them a profound understanding of the human world. As flawed an approach as this is, the premise of this walk/talk is that revolutionaries, radicals, utopians and trouble-makers can do the same.The precise content of the walk will be based (very) loosely on the wildlife we encounter, but it will more than likely include references to the disestablishment of nation states, Peter Kropotkin, polyamory, Silver Mt Zion and direct action tactics. And as the walk/talk will be firmly participatory, I would welcome others&#39; contributions, too.Knowledge of British breeding birds is not required. Indeed, I&#39;d prefer you forget any you have as it will probably interfere with my own half-baked hypothesising. (LBJ* = little brown job, an affectionate description that applies to the most apparently bland-looking native British songbirds.)"

How does culture and society affect our relationship to food? How do we lessen the abundance of waste? What do we understand as waste? What is discarded and what is embraced? L e s s e n i n g started from this set of questions and developed as an ongoing conversation. As we repeatedly experienced issues of waste within our locality, L e s s e n i n g came about as an awakening and a reconnection to our surroundings to acknowledge, reflect and eventually act on the current tendency to over-produce. We would like to invite people who are interested in similar issues and create a space for a conversation concerning the different values food can assume (economic, social, affective) and the consequential importance this has on the formation of communities. One persons’ waste is in fact another’s lifeline, and on the wider context food chains could feed the 5,000 over and over in the amount willfully discarded. We would like to discuss food as a turning point and explore how to relate to food and each other differently. The experiment will take the shape of an open conversation stimulated by the fragments of food and/or thought brought as instigators for further discussion, embracing the spirit of learning together collaboratively, horizontally – with everybody bringing in their own stories and expertise. We invite participants to join the discussion and bring their own food, ideas and stories to the table, to learn from each other how we can rethink our relationship to food consumption starting from the everyday: our kitchen, the street, workplaces as well as food chains, foodbanks and communal spaces."

Drawing on the experience of austerity in the UK and the vibrant art occupations of the bene comune movement in Italy (where Watson has been based since 2008), the conversation will ask what, if anything, a politicised art form can achieve post-economic Crisis. As state supported finance capital meets with  a surveillance machine ready to keep the population in check it seems doubtful that art can provide the answers where concrete political activism failed. All the while the art world itself is corrupt to its core with dealers, galleries, fairs, biennials, and collectors operating a racket, whilst workers often go unpaid or underpaid.Against this backdrop McGowan and Watson ask what, if anything an art based political response to our times might achieve?"

Culture is visible capital in the era of invisible electronic finance capital from the David Koch Plaza at the Metropolitan Museum to the gentrification of Brooklyn (to use NYC examples). We ask: of over 200 million hours of coerced labor in the Americas, how many are now incarnated in museums? No more human remains in museums. No expropriated colonial plunder. No products made with colonial goods or colonized labor. Why do you still have to be naked to be a woman and get into the Met, as the Guerrilla Girls have it? In NYC we call for cultural institutions to divest from Israel-Palestine and the prison-industrial complex and to offer a $25 an hour minimum wage in all cultural institutions. We occupy spaces, conduct alternative tours, demand transparency on budgets, trustees and boards of directors.

Unsurprisingly, some of the most exciting forms of contemporary creative expression rely heavily on such practices. However, the legal regimes designed to regulate technologies of reproduction view many of our activities as theft, piracy, or other violations of intellectual property (IP) law. This workshop addresses itself to artists who wish to use their practice to engage critically with issues of copyright, patents, and trademarks. Through open discussion, introduction of key concepts, and presentation of useful examples, we will explore the tensions between contemporary art-making and IP law. What do you need to know in order to resist the limitations IP law places on your ability to express yourself freely and creatively? Can your art practice assume an activist role in challenging restrictive IP policy? How can we mobilise tensions between creative expression and IP policy for activist purposes and critical debate?This workshop is led by three research-practitioners who share expertise in art-making, activism, and legal theory, along with the belief that creative expression should not be controlled by economic policies of private property."

It is intended as a provocative attempt to grapple with the agency of sonic materiality via practice-led research. In bypassing the usual lecture format where information is delivered to an audience by ‘an expert’, this event will involve a number of activities and discussions as an exploration of collective and non-traditional knowledge sharing. Taking the form of an hour-long (approx.) programme incorporating video, sound and performance, the attendees will be encouraged to participate using both spoken and non-verbal forms of articulation. In academia what is considered to be ‘an original contribution to knowledge’ champions the self determined individual intellect and promotes introversion and conceit. However, this gathering is intended to create a space for group indecision, uncertainty and befuddlement. It will propagate questions rather than provide answers. The event is intended to be of particular interest to anyone who is inquisitive about how philosophy might be exploited to inform art and how art might be used to ‘do’ philosophy. As a group we will noisily make non-informed generalisations about some of the most complex theories of our time. Outcomes of this event will contribute to a continued development of (un)sound research methodology."

Yet meeting in this middle ground can lead to a touchy-feely abandonment of our own sense of taste. Is it easier to empathise with someone who has killed another person, than someone who has made bad art? The workshop will be a presentation of key ideas, followed by exercises. The presentation will focus on the principles of compassionate communication, nonviolence and its application to art, ideas and social structures.

      "description"      : "[SYMPOSIUM] is a monthly free and open-access reading group for anyone interested in the intersections between art practice and critical theory. All decision-making is collective and participants are encouraged to chair the reading group on a selective and voluntary basis. Please visit the website to register and download the shared document.For June we have selected Jacques Rancière&#39;s essay Problems and Transformations of Critical Art. For Rancière, the problem of art is not in the clash between art and politics, but in the clash between the politics internal to art. Rancière describes this as a tension between formalist art and political art and he suggests that to be critical, art must negotiate between art and non-art. Hence, critical art “plays on the union and tension of different aesthetic politics… crossing the border between the world of art and the prosaic world of the commodity”. Rancière proposes the collage as such a “third way”. What are the consequences of this thesis for contemporary art practice? How does it re-frame traditional accounts of the transition from modernism to postmodernism? Why has  Rancière been the most popular philosopher in the art world since Jean Baudrillard? This discussion will be chaired by Stephen Bennett."

If not, why?Building on last year’s Occupy event, we’ll now take a practical look at exploring:-         What radical collecting actually is?-         The power of archives to affect change for social justice-         Your role in making history &amp; evening the balance in how our shared history is remembered. Community-led campaigns to create an archive of active social and political movements are taking place across the world: from the Occupy movement, Radical publishers, LGBT to Trade Union, and Black-led cultural movements. We’ll continue to draw inspiration from these movements, along with pioneers like C.L.R James, in how we can create crucial counter-narratives.Join us for a collective exploration of what we can all do to capture stories and memories that reverberate into the future."

      "description"      : "In this practical experimental workshop, prolific songwriter Magick Danny will share his unique lyric writing process step by step. Danny says, &quot;I analysed and compared the thinking and approaches of two types of songwriters: those who regularly write songs and those who don&#39;t. There are a few key differences. One is that the &#39;blocked&#39; writers are passive. They are waiting for inspiration to come to them. They have no means of going to the source from which that inspiration comes. And that&#39;s understandable - even the prolific writers don&#39;t really understand how they&#39;re tapping into that source. Meanwhile, many songwriters and creative people in general tend to share an idea that having such a method is somehow inartistic, or &#39;cheating&#39;. But that&#39;s nonsense. I developed my own method - a divination ritual that has allowed me to reliably tap a source of lyricism that previously was not available to me. My songwriting has improved in quality and quantity.&quot;For the first time, Danny will teach his magickal divination ritual for lyric writing to other songwriters and interested bystanders."

Collective reading, if you never experienced it before, is an enjoyably open structure for learning that often results in a conversation full of the tangential richness of interruption and digression. The idea of meeting at the allotment (in the shed if the weather is rainy) is that allotments are the last remaining traces of &quot;the commons&quot; and have their historical roots in the enclosure acts.

She discussed the artist as entrepreneur, complicity, dreams, non-binary explanations of power and why definitions of art are so polarised in a market-based economy.The lecture will be followed by an &#39;Artist’s Therapy&#39; taster session led by Bristol-based artist, Claudia Capocci, a democratically formatted discussion group, where people working in all forms of art can talk openly and without fear of judgement, in a trusting and informal environment, about issues surrounding art practice.

      "description"      : "We are approaching a new model (situation) of class society where – proletarianised along the trimensions of space, time and class - strikers (i.e. destructive workers) are deprived of their power. This is exactly where three-sided football has much to teach. Recent experiments in complexity vandalism saw moving goalposts (attached to bicyclic “fluxvehicles”) attempt to literally “stretch” the Greenwich Meridian. The aim was to trigger a quantum superpositional timeloop, catalysing a hypothesised collapse in imperialist spacetime. As the moving goalpost modification demonstrates, even as strikers (destructive workers) are disempowered by global capital’s increasing ability to transcend the hemispheres, there occurs a simultaneous empowerment of both reproductive workers (goalkeepers) and psychic workers (three-sided football players and self-organisers generally). When their autonomy is realised, the goalkeepers (reproductive workers) can take entangled, self-organizational action, whilst the psychic workers, the ones who build up the situation, can facilitate such actions to take place. The moving goalposts (dead workers) thus offer timely (and spacey and classy) advice for further dérive (psychic workers union) transfigurations. As three-sided football rewards the team who concedes the least, its natural rallying cry is “all power to the reproductive workers!” The contemporary game has begun to insufficiently reflect this however. By triolectically seizing and reconfiguring the goalposts (dead workers) themselves, we instantly facilitate an experimental tripling of reproductive workers’ relative power.

We will attempt to GET AROUSED by existing adverts and artworks, and GATHER DATA about our responses. We will DISCUSS and DE-CODE how aesthetic characteristics from colour to sound and frame rate effects our response to the media we experience. Building on the above, we will CONSTRUCT creative materials to support messages of resistance = neuromarketing campaigns for the citizen, not the consumer. Please bring examples of what you consider “effective” adverts and artworks (these could be image-based, text-based, videos, sound etc).All are welcome to be part of this attempt to reverse-engineer how creative skills can resist technologies of political control.This workshop kick starts the first in a series of workshops led by PHUNC throughout 2016 and beyond. We invite you to join us!What is &#39;Neuromarketing&#39;?&quot;Neuropower is concerned not with the production of subjectivity in the present but in the creation of a perfect consumer of the future&quot;, Warren Neidich.&quot;Advertisements are sunshine reports for reclining flesh… a massive defensive armature created by the mediascape&quot;, Arthur Kroker.Neuromarketing claims to help explain human behaviour by revealing what is happening inside of the &quot;black box&quot;of the mind (Fugate).Until very recently the methods marketing companies used to measure market and individual consumer behaviour depended largely upon inference, either through consumer reports, surveys and focus groups. In comparison, neuromarketing uses clinical information in the form of neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG, MEG) and biophysical monitors (galvanic skin response and facial recognition) about brain activity and biological mechanisms. Leveraging science to reveal what the consumer is actually feeling. One of several emerging fields in a wider neurocapitalist industry –neuromarketing integrates marketing, economics, interaction and UX design and neuroscience with personal digital technologies- communicating to consumers of semiconscious and emotional refrains, rather than treating and trusting them as cognitive subjects, is a new reality.

Nevertheless, the training that prepares astronauts for responding well to unfamiliar scenarios, supporting and cooperating with others and communicating across cultural differences for example, can be relevant and useful to many earth-dwellers too. Behavioural Training for Astronauts for Earthlings is an experimental workshop in which Giles Bunch will introduce fellow humanoids to some of the processes that European Space Agency astronauts go through as they develop behaviours preparing them for successful space flight. Following this introduction, Earthlings will be invited to collaboratively devise activities and rituals for developing behaviours in preparation for life on our current spaceship: Earth, as well as collectively questioning what values and behaviours will be desirable for future space-faring civilisations. At a moment of renewed interest in the human exploration of Mars, the outer solar system and beyond, Giles hopes to emphasise the social and ethical considerations of space travel over more commonly discussed technical details and to use the workshop as a situation for debating what our responsibilities are for the vessels carrying us, the places we explore and for each other."

      "description"      : "In the 1960s and 70s, R. D. Laing (1927-89), a native son of Glasgow, was one the world’s best-known psychiatrists. He was renowned for his controversial questioning of the distinction between sanity and madness, and his fellow feeling for those considered mentally ill—to the extent that some of his critics thought Laing himself mentally unsound. Having studied medicine at University of Glasgow and worked at Gartnavel Hospital in the 50s, he went on to write The Divided Self; Sanity, Madness and The Family; The Politics of Experience; and Knots (amongst other texts).Now, in the age of ‘big pharma’, with the proliferation of diagnoses (often for what might be thought forms of quite ordinary suffering) and with mental health services under strain, interest in Laing is growing again. His Divided Self, for instance, has become a Penguin Classic. A play about him was produced in London last year, and there is a biopic starring David Tennant in production.In this session, I’ll speak speak about my research in Laing’s archive, and we’ll discuss his work and ways of reading him.Anyone curious is welcome.

      "description"      : "As part of Performing Research Unit at Central School of Speech and Drama we did a practice based research on clowning in public spaces. We created an academic lecture to share our findings.Clown About Town: Clown Thresholds in Public Spaces - Performance LectureDo we know a clown when we see one? At what point can an interruption in a public space become clowning? Through the alteration of clown indicators such as gesture, appearance, duration and physicality, we play with interruption and disruption in public spaces to explore what that reveals about the semiotics of the clown. In this Performance Lecture we will present our findings about the interruptive clown experiments we did on and around Oxford Street. The lecture will be rigourously academic, disruptive and fun!Presented by: Samuel Hopkins, Helen Iskander, India Smith and Veronika Szabó"

      "description"      : "In the 1960s and 70s, R. D. Laing (1927-89), a native son of Glasgow, was one the world’s best-known psychiatrists. He was renowned for his controversial questioning of the distinction between sanity and madness, and his fellow feeling for those considered mentally ill—to the extent that some of his critics thought Laing himself mentally unsound. Having studied medicine at University of Glasgow and worked at Gartnavel Hospital in the 50s, he went on to write The Divided Self; Sanity, Madness and The Family; The Politics of Experience; and Knots (amongst other texts).Now, in the age of ‘big pharma’, with the proliferation of diagnoses (often for what might be thought forms of quite ordinary suffering) and with mental health services under strain, interest in Laing is growing again. His Divided Self, for instance, has become a Penguin Classic. A play about him was produced in London last year, and there is a biopic starring David Tennant in production.In this session, I’ll speak speak about my research in Laing’s archive, and we’ll discuss his work and ways of reading him.Anyone curious is welcome. No prior knowledge necessary. There will be plenty of time for questions and discussion.“If I could turn you on, if I could drive you out of your wretched mind … I would let you know”: Reading R. D.

Gramsci’s idea of commonsense – the taken for granted in the everyday - will be used to examine questions of migration provoked by ongoing events in the Mediterranean. Discourses about migration in Europe revolve around borders, control, exclusion and inclusion, openness and shared humanity. Understanding the ways in which commonsense works will help us to break down and to articulate these dissonant myths that exist around migration, and to make more visible how commonsense is a site of struggle.The conversation will also revolve around sites of culture and the way in which questions of representation in the visual have re-emerged in the light of the Mediterranean emergency."

It is cloaked in different forms of invisibility – either through secrecy and concealment, or through complexity, jargon and obscurity – and we often struggle to conceptualise how it works and how money moves.Making the invisible world of global finance visible is a highly important task and there are a range of exciting projects attempting to do just that. In this two day workshop, we will explore different approaches to unveiling the financial sector, from open data mapping and photography to computer games and digital art installation pieces. We will look at new attempts at visualisation and sonification, and consider how money might be accurately represented in an era of digital payment via offshore tax havens.Day 1 will be focused on explore, mapping and demystify the existing financial sector.Day 2 we will work towards building an &#39;Activist Bloomberg&#39;. The Bloomberg Terminal is an expensive system that major banks use to get raw data and financial information. The Terminal is out of reach to most ordinary people, but can we create an open-source and open-access alternative Bloomberg to collect and distribute critical data on high finance?

      "description"      : "Have you ever wondered why protest marches feel great but politically achieve very little? If so then this reasoning workshop is for you. Together we will explore ideas from Pan African history that were successful in challenging state sanctioned political violence. How can we adapt them to work in a modern Britain so obsessed with fighting terrorism that it instigates it through unjust legislation? Malcolm X taught that there were times when civil disobedience must be considered a progressive act of self-defence. When passive methods of direct action become ineffective, more assertive alternatives must take their place. We will discuss some non-violent modes of radical civil disobedience like the Occupy Movement and the election of the Syriza movement in Greece and ask why did they fail? When author Harold Zinn defined the source of most global problems as civil obedience he advocated the re-emergence of a spirit of resistance to “illegitimate authority and to forces that deprive people of their life and liberty”. Likewise Martin Luther King Jr argued that we all have “a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws”. What does this really mean? Come join us and as Thomas Sankara suggests “dare to invent the future”."

Within academia, reading set texts in private and discussing them in a group is commonplace. However, the curious mechanisms whereby marks on paper have meaning is often left unexplored. Similarly, other ways in which we might &#39;read&#39;, engaging other modes of our being, are underexplored. This workshop will extend the conventional definition of ‘reading’ to include the sense it is used in another context, that of psychic development, where ‘reading’ can also be an act of non-rational, non-verbal expressing of information, where the information is not conventionally codified, and where the information is obtained from non-textual sources, e.g. an object (psychometry) or a person (telepathy). In the workshop we will attempt to ‘read’ texts sealed inside envelopes, invisible to the naked eye. Participants will be encouraged to explain what meanings they are aware of, answer questions about those meanings, and discuss their interpretations, as well as reflect on the process of reading at its limits.

If not, how does creating your own archive matter in countering this? How do we intervene to ensure a more truthful and complete picture of the past? Can archives help to re-inspire new activism and affect change in our local communities? Who decides what we choose to remember Vs what we choose to forget?We encourage you to come armed with your own questions, but here are some more to kick-start the debate:Are we just a footnote in history? How do you ensure you’re not side-lined or silenced in historical memory? What can we learn from Black Power movements, radical publishers, and LGBT communities when it comes to creating crucial counter-narratives?Today, many mainstream heritage bodies still don’t reflect the true extent and diversity of voices that have profoundly shaped our local and global histories. If archives are the ‘raw stuff of history’ which historians draw upon, how do we ensure everyone’s voice is heard into the future?How do we document “the margins”? What is ‘radical’ or ‘marginal’?

Education is one such area, a heavily monetised international industry with fixed exchanges of words and ideas. Similarly, the internet can feel like a surveillance cum control system of orgasms, likes, visits and wishes. Data, information and words are everywhere, intertwined and increasingly mapped on to financial markets which now respond to our emotions via thumbs and smilies.As we live and attempt to resist and/or make the best of this, we remain bathed in unseen images and unheard noises, cocooned in an ever present flow of data. You do not need to attend this session to know this, but you will take part in a talk that explores these ideas and then hear sounds which expose, crack and attempt to break out. In a lecture/performance we research our core research questions: who owns the airwaves? Can energy be dictated? What can music, information and noise become?

In this session this quote will be used to frame discussions between five self-initiated projects, spaces and groups who will share the narratives of their creation thus far and collectively reflect on what role gender and feminist politics may play in their motivations, aims and processes. Speakers will include; members of research group CaW (Sophie Chapman, Carolina Escobar, Georgia Gendall, Bryony Hussey, Lou Macnamara, and Andra Raduca), Cheap Drinks (Rosa Farber and Helen Savage), KINGDOM (Kerri Jefferis and Ellie Wyatt), Ladette Space (Elena Colman) and Nice Gallery (Rosa Nussbaum).Expect discussions around knowledge sharing and building, collective care, the awareness and celebration of agency, women and DIY, sacrifice, methodologies, harnessing our ability self initiate, complicity and rejection, and breaking with the market and art celebrity with particular reference to sharing economies and cooperation as a strategy against austerity and the cult of individualism.Here we will question each other, so welcome those joining to also bring details of their projects as well as their own questions and stories."

      "description"      : "This participatory performance of Aristophanes’ most well-known play Lysistrata will give attendees the opportunity to participate in a group reading followed by a wider discussion of how sex and the body is used in political protest.Written in 411BC, Lysistrata is a comic play following the sexual politics of Ancient Greece. Led by the formidable Lysistrata, the women of Greece vow to hold a sex strike against their husbands and collectively storm the Acropolis, in the hope of bringing an end to the Peloponnesian War. This strategy, however, does not go as smoothly as first hoped, and the struggle for power between men and women intensifies.This anti-war tale of sex, gender, politics and militancy will provide an excellent jumping off point to talk about contemporary instances of sex strikes, naked protest and other forms of body-related activism. Examples could include the women of the Filipino town of Dado who brought the end of a period of violence with a week-long sex strike, to Votes4Nudes, a Canadian Instagram campaign that aims to motivate previously apathetic voters by rewarding poling station selfies with saucy snaps in their inbox. We encourage participants to bring their own examples to share for an open-minded, supportive and fun discussion of the body, feminism, humour, and the common ground – and differences – between Lysistrata’s Greece and today."

By improvising your own tools and then putting them to use together to make new things, the workshop aims to demonstrate how you can teach yourself to act as a designer and maker. Learn to see designed objects not as black boxes, but as assemblies of things that can be broken down and reconfigured in new and unexpected ways. Learn that you don&#39;t have to accept what is given to you by professionals, but that you can act yourself, in a spirit of free and unruly adaptation. Take control of your material surroundings, and learn to see the designed world not as a fait-accompli, but something that can be changed, to your own ends. Materials and tools provided."

Explore the story behind your phone in this practical workshop.Unfortunately, many people are not aware of where their mobile phones come from and how they are made. This means that it’s commonplace for consumers to be unaware of many serious issues that plague the mobile phone supply chain. From the social issues surrounding conflict minerals and the environmental impact of mining and phone production, through to dealing with e-waste, the story of your phone needs to be revealed.This workshop is a hands on introduction geared up to expose the social and environmental issues that plague the mobile phone supply chain. In this practical workshop you will urban mine your phone - in other words, dismantle it, extract the minerals and examine the pieces. Through opening up your phone and taking it apart, the workshop helps you to understand your device. By exploring some of the minerals that your phone contains, looking into the mining-related issues and discussing the environmental concerns created by e-waste, we aim to bring you closer to your mobile phone.NOTE: It is unlikely that your phone can be reassembled after this process!"

      "description"      : "A workshop in practical triolectics, comprising an introduction to the triolectical system of Situationist artist Asger Jorn, conducted via the medium of three-sided football.Jorn rejected transactional modes of knowledge transfer, favouring experimental activity. A supporter of the Situationist Bauhaus in Sweden, he believed such experiments fundamental to both psychic and social revolution. Underpinning Jorn’s approach was his unique ‘triloectical’ system. Developing upon dialectics and quantum physics, it went beyond linear transfers of energy, constructing spatio-temporal fields of possibility and negotiation. Not oppositional but superpositional – contradictions resolved by blending multiple simultaneous potentialities.As a practical pedagogical exploration of the triolectical system, three-sided football stands in continuity with the aims of the AntiUniversity’s original protagonists, such as Jorn’s fellow ex-situationist, Alex Trocchi. The game has formerly been played at locations of psychogeographical significance around the world – from a forest at the centrepoint of Europe, to Taksim Square, to inside a Soviet fuel silo, to a druidic stone circle. This time we have selected the significant, if little known undulating terrain surrounding the Omphalos of the British Empire – constructed in the 16th Century by John Dee - as part of an ongoing campaign towards the psychogeographical unbinding of Eurocentric topological thought."

      "title"    : "The Social Construction of Taste",
      "description"      : "How is it that some foods can be tasty and yet their consumption is considered tasteless, perhaps even disgusting? Insects, for example, are an excellent source of nutrients, feature in the diets of most populations around the world, and can be prepared in delicious ways, yet many of us show revulsion at the very thought of it.One way to get at this question is to ask why we use the word ‘taste’ to describe things that are far beyond the reach of our tongue. We talk about our personal tastes, even when referring to things that we have no intention of putting in our mouths. Our taste in music is not determined by the licking of cds or the chewing of vinyl. Conversely, we might indicate our dislike or disapproval of something by saying it is ‘tasteless’, perhaps even ‘disgusting’. We might even perform the visible actions of physical disgust when confronted by things we find cultural objectionable; we act out our approbation with the wrinkling of the nose, the turn of the lip, the gape of the tongue, as if the very idea is making us gag.In this session I’ll be expanding on these ideas to consider why the idea of eating insects makes us queasy and how we communicate these evaluations of ‘taste’ between one another, establishing cultural preferences for some foods and not for others.For the brave souls in attendance I’ll also provide insect-based snacks for people to try."

Our assembly welcomes any proposals, in whatever form, that speak of/to those concerns; we meet in a collapsed, negative space, a space of ruin, to draw attention to what is neglected, made useless, temporarily occupy it, not to reclaim it, but in order to remain with what itself remains, without use or function, and in so doing to think through exhaustion, withdrawal, nullity.

The walk is an opportunity to learn both about Islington’s rich cinematic past and the chance to discover the layers of history that are often hidden within the architecture of the urban everyday. In the walk we will see cinemas that are still standing, even if no longer used, picture-palaces that have left only ghostly traces of their former glory and structures that need our imagination to project the past into the present.More can be found out about Islington&#39;s Lost Cinemas at: www.islingtonslostcinemas.com, both a cultural history website and art project that charts and celebrates the history of cinemas in Islington.Details about the meeting point will be communicated once booked.
