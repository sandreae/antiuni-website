    "description": "Intestinal Knitting is an experimental knitting workshop, aiming to rethink the women‚Äôs craft association of knitting.\n\nThe workshop plays with the cosy associations of knitting, to challenge the traditional hierarchy of the arts, were painting and sculpture are viewed as high art, while knitting and embroidery is viewed as low art or craft.\n\nIn the same way as the arts, there is also a hierarchy of internal organs, with the heart and the brain more highly prized than waste processing organs, including bladders and intestines.  Of all the internal organs, intestines evoke the greatest disgust, with their ability to pulverise, liquidise and vaporise matter to level all humans.\n\nThe social taboos and embarrassment surrounding the natural functioning of the intestine, may sadly account for Bowel Cancer being the 2nd largest cancer killer in the UK, with around 16,000* deaths per a year.  However awareness of the symptoms and early detection significantly improves the survival rate.  (*statistics from Bowel Cancer UK)\n\n‚Ä¢\tKnitting simple tubes, using both flat and double pointed needles\n‚Ä¢\tSoft sculpture, and shaping your intestine.\n‚Ä¢\tDecorating your intestine with crochet villi\n\nSuitable for all abilities, there will be with demonstration videos, diagrams of techniques, infographics and further ideas.  Participants will be able to have online discussions with their peers and post images of their knitted creations.\n\nWorking with yarns and recycled materials, participants will be able to explore and make their own discoveries, while also learning practical skills.  The emphasis is on making an experimental piece of artwork, although the techniques can be adapted to make garments or functional objects.\n\nThe session will be taught informally through a Facebook group, and will run throughout the duration on the Antiuniversity Festival (10am Saturday 4th ‚Äì 11.59pm Friday 10th September), allowing participants to work at their own pace.",

The session will comprise a re-staging of **SPILLS** (2021) for 30 minutes, followed by an open discussion including (but not limited to) topics such as affect, neoliberal academia and creative labour. \n\nThis work was originally produced on the occasion of *Tactics & Praxis: Creativity, Pleasure & Ethics in Academic Work*, an annual conference hosted by Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH), University of Cambridge. \n\n**Please e-mail spills2021@gmail.com to register your interest and receive session Zoom details.**\n\n‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê\n\n**Geiste Kincinaityte** is an artist and researcher, who calls her self an alien anthropologist. Her image-making practice is defined by encounters with the eerie, which is understood to be both the cessation of a comfort zone - whether self, human, habitat, milieu - and alertness to a yet-to-be-identified presence. She is currently undertaking her PhD in Film and Screen Studies at the University of Cambridge. \n\n**Elaine Tam** is an itinerant curator-writer-researcher from Hong Kong, currently working at White Cube, London. She collaborates with artists and thinkers to create new forms and forums for critical engagement; her practice is an interdisciplinary site for play, pleasure, gesture and, importantly, failure.

We will then work in pairs or trios for this silent walk, during which we will be observing and witnessing places, movement, bodies and sensations. There will be opportunities to respond in movement to the place/s found on the walk. After the walk, we will gather to share our findings verbally as well as with movement, drawing and writing.\n\nWe acknowledge artist Simon Whitehead who inspired the format of the walking score.\n\nThis workshop will be held outdoors (at times with shelter), rain or shine. Please bring\nwaterproofs. The meeting point is outside 48 Aberfeldy Street. We will be socially distanced, following safety guidelines and hand washing/sanitising will be available. Please bring your own mask.\n\nBooking is essential.\n\n-------\n\n**ABOUT THE ARTISTS**\n\n**Bettina Fung | È¶ÆÂÖÅÁèä** is a Hong Kong born, British-Chinese artist based in the UK. Interested in the expansive and immediate nature of drawing and often focusing on its performative aspect, her practice encompasses live art, 2D and site-specific works that have explored and questioned subjects of legacy, belonging, futility, productivity and progress.\n\n**Colleen Bartley** is an independent dance artist with an eclectic background. Her performance, film and installation work all include elements of improvisation. She‚Äôs interested in the unknown and setting up conditions to orient/disorient, discover new movement and explore in collaboration with other artists.

She curates events and creates immersive experiential experiences using dance, images, sound and text.\n\n-----\n\nThis workshop is part of 'Sensing. Place. Making. Time.

Everybody is welcome: culture workers, students and people with an interest in contemporary art.\n\n\nThis Saturday 4 September, we will be chatting about Thirza Cuthand's piece Reclamation (2018) 13min, which articulates ideas about climate change, coloniality, climate justice and speculative documentary, among other things.\n\n\nWe'll be meeting on Zoom on Saturday 4 June at 3pm. I (Irene, the organiser) will be connected 5 minutes before we start, to say hi and to sort out any technical issues, should there be any.

We counter the phallogocentric author-individual aka the genius with collective authorship. Also, Bermuda replaces the hero with thirteen antagonists and decentralizes the story. In this Universe, which is a carrier bag, you do not follow the story, you collect it.\n\nIn the first part of the workshop, we will play Bermuda together, talk about how to move through it, exchange insecurities, and discuss our interests, critique, and experience.You will then get the opportunity to choose one antagonist and write a  from their perspective. Your story will be added to the next version of Bermuda (2022). I especially want to invite inexperienced video-game players of all ages and people who are interested in writing.\n‚Ä®‚Ä®",

    "description": "'People never become altogether empty shells. A glimmer of life remains in the faceless Ensis and zeks who seem more like springs and wheels than like human beings. They are potential human beings. They are, after all, the living beings responsible for the cadaver‚Äôs coming to life, they are the ones who reproduce, wean and move the Leviathan. Its life is but a borrowed life; it neither breathes nor breeds; it is not even a living parasite; it is an excretion and they are the ones who excrete it.\n\nThe compulsive and compulsory reproduction of the cadaver‚Äôs life is the subject of more than one essay. Why do people do it? This is the great mystery of civilized life.'\n\nA discussion of Fredy Perlman's Against His-story, Against Leviathan! hosted by FORGED BOOKS.\n\nThe session will begin with a reading From the text.\n\nWe'll be reading https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/fredy-perlman-against-his-story-against-leviathan#toc1 from 'She‚Äôs the first protagonist.

    "title": "The university as the site of ongoing eugenics",
    "description": "How can we fight eugenics in the 21st-century? In this talk and discussion, I will be arguing that the first step is to understand what eugenics is and to overcome the highly ideologically distorted orthodox narrative about eugenics. According to that story, eugenics is a primarily an extreme right-wing phenomenon, always associated with racism, which ended after 1945. This factually incorrect narrative serves to disarm resistance to ongoing mainstream eugenic practices, and to protect geneticists and other academics from criticism, since they can rightly point out that they do not hold such views and, indeed, condemn them. A better understanding, which views eugenics as a form of technocratic social control supported by both liberal and right-wing elites, allows us to understand how it has persisted under other names, in the university until the present day.\n\nIn Britain, the key centres of organised eugenics were always associated with the leading universities, such as UCL, Cambridge and King‚Äôs College London, and this has continued up to the present.  Eugenics in Britain continues to operate as a form of knowledge/power and academic expertocracy, through advice to policy makers.  I will discuss how the academic discipline of molecular biology originated in the eugenics movement, and how the long-term agenda of the Rockefeller Foundation is now culminating in the birth of the first genetically modified babies in 2018, and a push by scientists for legalisation in the UK. I will reflect on the experience of the Commission of Enquiry on eugenics at UCL, and how the focus on historical eugenics simply perpetuates the received history and disarms resistance.\n\nMeeting link https://meet.jit.si/moderated/211ebc9aefbf1242cb883f2fd81797ee35fdf7a5da9edc01c195a3d8add91e61",

    "description": "The Rebel City Collective has been producing a newspaper for London for many years (See our website). Recently, we have embarked on an ambitious project to bring anarchist ideas into schools and colleges.  We have been getting more and more requests for sessions, even during the pandemic. \nIt has been a real learning experience for us as the students ask many insightful and penetrating questions which has forced us to clarify our own ideas. Questions such a: how will you ensure all the unpopular jobs get done?, what to do about crime?, doesn‚Äôt anarchism mean disorganisation?, require careful thought and cannot be answered glibly. Though we do not all share the same opinions on everything in the Collective, by discussing together we are working out how to be more effective in our answers. \nThis workshop will share our work on answering challenging questions and participants will be invited to ask their own questions and also try answering some! \n",

    "title": "Anarchist Communism vs Big Tent Anarchism The distinctive tradition of anarchist communism yesterday and today",
    "description": "Anarchism is a political tradition that unites a number of different anti-authoritarian currents and is seen as an alternative to the Leninist tradition. However, anarchism itself has been divided historically, to an extent over the ultimate goal, but largely over important issues of political analysis, strategy and tactics. The situation is the same today. \nThis session will look at the distinct tradition of communist anarchism to explore how it is both similar and different to other currents. Some of these differences are far from trivial and often put our current in opposition to those who have been grouped under what we call big tent anarchism. It is not a question of sectarianism, as we work with a wide range of anarchists in grass roots campaigns and projects, but with how we can best build an effective revolutionary anarchist movement. \nThe issues we will discuss are not just of interest to anarchists. Questions such as the role of organisation, insurrectionism, analysis of class, freedom and collective responsibility, attitude towards Labour, support for national liberation are relevant to all who are concerned with social transformation.  We will address these questions in the context of specific contexts, from the Russian Revolution to today‚Äôs pandemic. \n",

    "title": "Reading, viewing and doing groups: exploring informal spaces of learning",
    "description": "We participate in reading, viewing and doing groups on neurodiversity, disability, critical mental health, mad studies/activism, care, and psychopolitics. Some of us are facilitators, others not. Some of our groups have been running for a long time, others we are just imagining how to set them up. Regardless, we are all interested in these informal spaces of learning which allow us to encounter and exchange experiences and ideas otherwise.\nOur knowledge is not only on the readings, viewings and doings we choose, but also on the ways we meet - e.g. when we do not only read and talk about care but develop practices of mutual care. We want to gather to celebrate our knowing practices and generate a space for further encounter and exchange. We want to honor our differences, yet acknowledge interdependence and the interconnectedness of our struggles, finding ways to build solidarities and connections among movements for justice.\n\nPOSSIBLE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS\nHow do we read-view-do in our group (in advance / in the moment)? How do we meet to discuss? How often? For how long? \nWho participates in our meetings? Do we have a facilitator/facilitating strategy?\nAre our meetings online or in-person? Has it always been this way?\nWhere do we meet? Which physical space or online platform? Why there? \nSince when have we been meeting? What would we highlight from our group?\nWhich kind of texts-films-activities do we pay attention to? How are those chosen? Are there any that standed out? Any session in particular? \nDo our readings-films-activities inform our collective practice? Does our group have any ground rules? Have we made any considerations in regards to access? What are our reflections/experiences on making it a safe/brave/inviting space?\nWhat is the future like for these groups? How can we combine online and in-person meet-ups? \nAFTER-EVENT FOLLOW-UP\nWe will invite people to contribute to our rise-up pad for suggesting ideas during or after the event and to ask if you/your group/network would like to be part of a festival of online reading/watching/doing groups in 2022, connected to the themes of CARE *ECOLOGY *EXPERIMENT *MENTAL-HEALTH *ORGANISING \n\nAccess information:\nDuring the event itself, we will have facilitators available to ensure that everyone has a chance to speak/chat and that any comments/questions are read out (please let us know if you would like to help with facilitation).  \nOur gathering will take place online on the platform Jitsi Meet. On the day, you will need a good internet connection and one device - either smartphone, computer, laptop, tablet or chromebook. If you registered on Eventbrite, you will receive a link via email the day before. You do not need to open an account on Jitsi to join us (you can use a nickname if you prefer).\n\nWe will gather for around 90 minutes and everybody is invited to take part in the conversation. While we would love to listen and see you all, we are keen on people joining in their own way: speaking up, writing on the text-chat, only listening, cameras on or off - whatever feels more comfortable. You can also take part via email (anna.stenning@gmail.com).\n\nWe will not be recording this gathering, and there will be no BSL interpretation, audio-descriptions, nor captions provided on the day.\n\nWe are learning how to make our gatherings more accessible. If you have any suggestions or enquiries, please get in touch with us via email at anna.stenning@gmail.com We will do our best to accommodate, this time and in future.\n",

    "description": "Organized by the Museum-of-Care Begins 830pm\nThe writings of anarchist and anthropologist David Graeber have broken open new ways to think about our world in ways that couldn‚Äôt simply be dismissed by the establishment.   Insightful anthropology of the many examples for alternative organization of society informed his writing as much as his social movement involvement and careful analysis of bullshit economics.  The Museum-of-Care was an idea suggested by David before he passed away last year during the pandemic.  Taking its name from the fate of an aristocratic palace in the centre of Paris after the French revolution (it‚Äôs now a museum) this experimental collective combines art, activism and reading to explore a world with more care in it.  Graeber‚Äôs work looks at Debt, Anarchist Anthropology, Bullshit Jobs and the many ways in which ‚Äòanother world is possible‚Äô in the words of social movements today.  David Graeber in his work pointed out that not only is another world possible but many have already happened and everyday university histories of humanity tend to not tell these stories of alternatives.  Join this online session to discuss the new (posthumously released) book, The Dawn of Everything book by David Graeber and David Wengrow (an archaeologist that David worked with; he‚Äôs still alive).  The book won't be out until October but we'll be discussing an early summary article ‚ÄúHow to change the course of human history‚Äù that the two authors wrote in 2018 before the book was out https://www.eurozine.com/change-course-human-history/ If you want to skim read this summary first, that‚Äôs great but we will also be starting off with a careful overview so you can also just bring your own experiences and join the discussion!  \n  Registration is by the eventbrite link below\n\n",

    "description": "The question of who owns, controls, and benefits from land underlies all our struggles for social and environmental justice: for truly affordable housing, for good quality locally grown food for our communities, for more green space, and for land use systems that help restore ecological systems and combat climate change. Decisions about how to use land and who benefits are largely made by the tiny minority who own the land: the aristocracy, agribusiness, corporations for whom land is an investment, and government agencies that are not controlled directly by the public such as the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence. \nMany people are realising the importance of transforming the current land system and fighting for change. This session will first introduce the problems created by the current land system, consider what needs to change, and look at the growing movement for land justice. \n",

    "description": "Image produced by NUS Students Not Suspects campaign 2015.\n\nWe are a network of people committed to countering the spread of policing practices in education from Prevent to the surveillance of migrant students, cops on campus to the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which extends police powers and deputises all of us in the criminalisation of our students. We invite you to join us in building on the ground resistance to these insidious practices. We ask: How can we, in our classrooms, in administration, in our pastoral roles, stand against policing in education?\n\nIn this session we will explore how different systems of policing penetrate and permeate the educational environment in both overt and covert forms, and how this undermines the learning process.\n\nThe first part of this session will be an exercise in how to navigate difficult discussions about policing in education: what it looks like, why it should be opposed, and how we can resist it.\n\nThis will involve role playing to practice these conversations and unpacking ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô assumptions about the inevitability of policing in schools and unis. We will explore what to say to your colleagues when they argue that Prevent helps counter the spread of far right violence, or that students should be surveilled for their own protection. \n\nWe will then build on these conversations to produce visual resources together, designed to capture the absurdity of policing practices in education, and the reality of how they hinder learning. We hope that these resources will act as the basis of posters, stickers, zines which could be distributed around campuses, signalling to students that we oppose their criminalisation and acting as points of reference to support us in having our difficult conversations with apathetic or ambivalent colleagues. \n\nNo prior knowledge or artistic skills required. All are welcome.\n",

    "description": "*What are the particular challenges to labour organising that are faced by cultural workers?*\n*Can we adapt traditional organising strategies and learn from past struggles?*\n*What new tools or principles might be necessary to take on the cultural industry and win?*\n\nWork in the cultural sector is fragmented, precarious, and poorly regulated. While certain cultural work is well unionised, huge sections of the workforce remain unrepresented and prevented from organising by employment practices that keep workers atomised and on short-term freelance contracts, promoting individualisation, competitiveness, and fear of blacklisting. Existing collective agreements cannot keep up with the constant creation of new job types and contracts, which offer little security and deny workers their basic rights. Cultural workers are overworked, burnt out and underpaid, making organising all the more challenging, yet all the more essential if we are to demand a just recovery of the sector.\n\nOn the first Wednesday of each month, the Designers + Cultural Workers branch of United Voices of the World holds an all-member meeting, giving an opportunity for all current and prospective members to find out more about how the union organises, feed ideas into campaigns, connect with other members, and share knowledge.\n\nThis month‚Äôs meeting will be **open to all** and take place during the Antiuniversity Festival, for a more social and playful event!\n\nTogether we will test run tools from newly launched [transformyour.work](https://transformyour.work/) like [~Interviewing your double](https://transformyour.work/6e2f9932a0764e8d979236bd241dc93d) or [~Cultural Artefacts](https://transformyour.work/bc9773ac4dd841aa810e8b35262a5515)\n\n**Join us whatever your sector is** üé® üíª üé≠ üé∂ ‚úÇÔ∏è üè´\n\n**IRL EVENT: Book your tickets through the [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/antiuniversity-now-organising-the-cultural-sector-a-social-tickets-169439013651) link below!**\n\nVenue details: head to the Bertrand Russell Room (seating capacity of 35) at Conway Hall.

    "description": "**This is a bat walk with a difference. A search not just for hidden urban bats, but also data systems that shape change in the city. All are welcome!**\n\nBats are common in London, but often go unnoticed. They roost in roofs and trees, and forage in parks, gardens and waterways. What‚Äôs more, they are vulnerable to the churn of development. Buildings they roost in may be knocked down, features they navigate by might be changed, or new lighting could disrupt their feeding spots. Bats are protected by law, so bats can also affect how the city changes ‚Äì though these protections are not always up to the job.\n\nLike bats in the dark, the systems, decisions, and forces that reshape our city can be difficult to perceive, even as they benefit some and displace others. So as we search for bats, we‚Äôll investigate systems and processes that affect all the city‚Äôs inhabitants.\n\nHow? Together we‚Äôll explore the area with bat detectors and special-made ‚Äúdatasniffers‚Äù. The bat detectors let us hear the high frequency calls bats use to echolocate. The datasniffers let us hear the presence of records from a London planning database, hinting at how the city is changing.\n\nAfter, we‚Äôll talk about our experience of the walk using the devices. We‚Äôll make space to reflect on how the area is changing, the effects on humans, bats and others, and how we might like things to be different.\n\n**Places are limited, so please sign up via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/nightsniffing-a-walk-exploring-bats-data-and-urban-change-tickets-165524605551).**",

    "description": "Solidarity Not Charity: Mutual Aid throughout the pandemic and possibilities for post-crisis communities of care\n\n**TICKET LINK AT BOTTOM OF PAGE AND DESCRIPTION**\n\nThe pandemic has turned the world upside down and back to front. People that wouldn't normally think of themselves as political have been appalled by the inhumanity and unjust nature of government policy. Indeed, they've seen our governments as representing a gathering of all that is rotten in the debris of human depravity; contorted by greed, selfishness and inhumanity in their efforts to maintain a status quo through a deadly pandemic. \n\nThis has meant many people have been touched by the misfortune of society not working for them; have felt helplessness for the first time, and have found solidarity and support in the actions of others. \n\nThis presents a new frontier for Mutual Aid; as groups as diverse as village green societies to radical housing cooperatives have come together to support each other and their communities; building bridges across previously unassailable political divides.\n\nThis session aims to take stock of the state of mutual aid today by reflecting on just some of the stories we've seen and been a part of. We invite participants to bring their own stories too as we discuss the possibilities for mutual aid in the future. \n\nin the face of impending climate crisis, this pandemic might only be the tip of a rapidly melting ice-berg of what is to come in the future. A politics and broad social solidarity founded in the lessons of mutual aid might give us both the outlook to stop suffocating our world and the bonds to bring us together in solidarity and protection against the extremes our near future holds. \n\nThe pandemic has provided the biggest flashpoint in a generation, and the first opportunity for the capitalist realism that haunts our society to be dealt a death blow. But if we are to overcome, we must discuss, strategize and act. This session provides a space for doing just that.\n\nPlease join us!\n\n**TICKETS HERE** https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solidarity-not-charity-cov19-mutual-aid-post-crisis-communities-of-care-tickets-164121049477",

We will then work in pairs or trios for this silent walk, during which we will be observing and witnessing places, movement, bodies and sensations. There will be opportunities to respond in movement to the place/s found on the walk. After the walk, we will gather to share our findings verbally as well as with movement, drawing and writing.\n\nWe acknowledge artist Simon Whitehead who inspired the format of the walking score.\n\nThis workshop will be held outdoors (at times with shelter), rain or shine. Please bring\nwaterproofs. The meeting point is outside 48 Aberfeldy Street. We will be socially distanced, following safety guidelines and hand washing/sanitising will be available.

    "title": "Demystifying Regeneration - counter propaganda objects at ANARCHIST BOOK FAIR",
    "description": "Stall with counter propaganda objects at ANARCHIST BOOK FAIR on 11/09/21, 12-3pm, Conway Hall.\n\nArtist Julika Gittner‚Äôs stall at the anarchist bookfair shows objects and videos that expose the main manipulation and disinformation techniques commonly used by local authorities and their hired consultants to influence residents‚Äô opinions in estate regeneration schemes. Based on my findings from the ongoing consultation process at the St Raphael‚Äôs estate in Brent, London NW10, the sculptural diagrams illustrate key facts and figures that directly challenge the council's unscrupulous push for the demolition of the estate. The pieces question the aesthetics of common factual persuasion methods and propose an alternative visual language for the propagation of counter-knowledge through activist art.\n \nThe works presented at the fair are part of the art and research project Manufacturing Discontent that uses sculptural visualisations to render the physical and spatial implications of abstract data tangible and accessible to non-experts. Data-based visual representations of social, economic and political realities are widely used by political establishments to manipulate peoples‚Äô consent to profit driven decisions in urban regeneration projects under the guise of statistical objectivity. The need to challenge dis-information and misrepresentation through visual advocacy is recognised by resistance movements such as Architects for Social Housing (ASH) who supply campaign groups with ‚Äòcounterpropaganda‚Äô (Elmer and Dening, 2016) to challenge local governments data-based rationale for social housing estate demolitions in London. However, the complexity and abstraction of the contested information makes it largely inaccessible to non-experts and hard to refute via conventional textual and graphic forms of campaign media. This project devises ways to use objects to expand the visual pallet of protest in order to contest the ‚Äòtruths‚Äô propagated by the regeneration machine.\n \n \nJulika Gittner practices and teaches across the disciplines of art and architecture. Her sculpture, performance, sound and video works have been shown internationally and explore the social and political role of art and architecture. In 2019 Julika was awarded the AHRC SWW DTP2 PhD studentship to undertake an interdisciplinary practice-based PhD in Fine Art and Architecture at the Universities of Reading and Cardiff that looks at devising a sculptural practice that enables the communication of counter evidence in today‚Äôs contested politics of space. \n\n",

    "description": "The Antiuniversity and the Anarchist Bookfair in London are joining forces in 2021 to bring together a week-long Antiuniversity Festival from the 4th to the 10th of September and the Anarchist Bookfair on the 11th and 12th of September.\n\nThe Bookfair will be a two days event, with stalls at Conway Hall in Red Lion Square on the 11th of September, and a day of online streaming workshops and discussions on the 12th of September.\n\nTo book a stall or a workshop for the Bookfair events, please get in touch with the Bookfair Collective early, as spaces might be limited. The physical event has been scaled down in order to be Covid responsible, and we will be assessing the ongoing situation.\n\nAntiuniversity events will be programmed in the usual way, directly through the Antiuni website. Submissions will be open between 3-24 July and the programme will go live in early August.\n\nThe entire festival, 4-12 Sept, will take place in-person (when possible) and digitally.\n\nThe bookfair collective will be holding weekly meetings until then. Anyone who is interested in joining, please get in touch, via our social media pages, or email.",
