<span class="anti">Antiuniversity Now</span> is a collaborative experiment to challenge institutionalised education, access to learning and the mechanism of knowledge creation and distribution.

Initiated in 2015, <span class="anti">Antiuniversity Now</span> was set up to reignite the 1968 Antiuniversity of London with the intention to challenge academic and class hierarchy and the exclusivity of the Â£9K-a-year-degree by inviting people to organise and share learning events in public spaces all over the country.

**Who makes the Antiuniversity?**<br/>
Antiuniversity events are open to all to organise and attend, regardless of experience, background, age or qualification. All you need is an interesting idea and an openness to share it with others in a collaborative way. Head to this yearâ€™s <a href="https://antiuni-2021.samandreae.com/" target="_blank">festival platform</a> to upload or browse events.
For inspiration, you can check out the Antiuniversity <a href="/archive">archive</a>!

**What does an Antiuni event look like?**<br/>
Events can take any form, anywhere (as long as we donâ€™t put each other at risk). They are free, accessible and inclusive, using non-hierarchical, participatory and democratic pedagogy.

**What are the rules?**<br/>
The Antiuniversity does not have a fixed constitution â€“ it is shaped by everyone who takes part, as organiser, host or guest.<br/>
However, all our activities are firmly rooted in a collective desire to create and sustain safe autonomous spaces for radical learning that follow, nurture and enact anti-capitalist, anarchist, feminist, anti-racist, de-colonial, anti-fascist, queer, trans and sex worker- inclusive values through conversation and direct action.<br/>
All events will be accepted, providing they do not cause any harm.<br/>

<span class="anti">Antiuniversity Now</span> is organised by a collective of activists and organisers, with support from many groups, organisations and individuals. Please <a href="/contact" target="_blank">ðŸ“® get in touch ðŸ“¬</a> if you would like to get involved.

<h4>THE 1968 ANTIUNIVERSITY OF LONDON</h4>

![Alt text](/assets/images/antiuni-poster-68.png)
  
The Antiuniversity was an organisation and an education experiment in the late 1960s based in Rivington Street, east London.

It included iconic figures such as C.L.R James, Stokely Carmichael, Juliet Mitchell, R.D. Laing and Stuart Hall who wanted to break the structures forced by institutions such as schools, universities and hospitals.

The Antiuniversity wanted to allow people to meet each other without having to act out socially prescribed roles, believing that this would 'expose the terrible reality of modern life, in which nobody really knew anyone, and spark a revolution'. <br />

Despite being short-lived and mostly shrouded in mystery, the Antiuniversity continues to capture the imagination of anyone interested in alternative education, self-organisation, non-hierarchical structures and radical learning.
