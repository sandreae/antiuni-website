Antiuniversity Now is a collaborative experiment to challenge institutionalised education, access to learning and the mechanism of knowledge creation and distribution.

Initiated in 2015, Antiuniversity Now was set up to reignite the 1968 Antiuniversity of London with the intention to challenge academic and class hierarchy and the exclusivity of the Â£9K-a-year-degree by inviting people to organise and share learning events in public spaces all over the country.

Antiuniversity Now events are organised by academics and autodidacts, experts and enthusiasts and are open to all regardless of experience, background, age or qualification.
They are free, accessible and inclusive and are delivered using non-hierarchical, participatory and democratic pedagogy.

The Antiuniversity does not have a fixed constitution - it is shaped by everyone who takes part, as organiser, host or guest.
However, all our activities are firmly rooted in a collective desire to create and sustain safe autonomous spaces for radical learning that follow, nurture and enact anti-capitalist, anarchist, feminist, anti-racist, de-colonial, anti-fascist, queer, trans and sex workers inclusive values through conversation and direct action.

All event submissions are accepted, providing they do not cause any harm.

THE 1968 ANTIUNIVERSITY OF LONDON

The Antiuniversity was an organisation and an education experiment in the late 1960s based in Rivington Street, east London.
It included iconic figures such as C.L.R James, Stokely Carmichael, Juliet Mitchell, R.D. Laing and Stuart Hall who wanted to break the structures forced by institutions such as schools, universities and hospitals.

The Antiuniversity wanted to allow people to meet each other without having to act out socially prescribed roles, believing that this would 'expose the terrible reality of modern life, in which nobody really knew anyone, and spark a revolution'.

Despite being short-lived and mostly shrouded in mystery, the Antiuniversity continues to capture the imagination of anyone interested in alternative education, self-organisation, non-hierarchical structures and radical learning.
