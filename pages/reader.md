<span class="wavy">Antiuniversity Now's Reader</span>
  
To mark the 50th anniversary of the original Antiuniversity (opened February 1968), we created this public [reading list](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1904952203153596.1073741882.1462096140772540&type=1&l=b9daa57df8), with books about radical learning, autonomous education, anarchist pedagogy and other relevant ideas.
Please add your suggestions by commenting on the [facebook album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1904952203153596.1073741882.1462096140772540&type=1&l=b9daa57df8). We will aim to add relevant publications and collectively grow the list.

Some of the books are available from [PM Press](https://pmpress.org.uk/product-category/reading-lists/antiuni/) , who offer Antiuniversity readers a 25% discount and will donate another 25% from each book to the Antiuni!
Use the code AntiUni when ordering.

Have you read any of these books and would like to share your experience with others (not everyone learns through reading)? [Organise](https://festival.antiuniversity.org/register) an Antiuni event!

Also check out these excellent reading lists by our comrades at [Art&Critique](https://artandcritique.uk/alt-art-edu/) and [School of the Damned](https://issuu.com/schoolofthedamned).
